<h1>The Art of Webscraping III: Scraping Reddit<a class="headerlink" href="#the-art-of-webscraping-iii-scraping-reddit" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h1>
<p>In the past two notebooks in this webscraiping series, we saw how we could use Python to automate getting data from websites. First <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">beautifulsoup</span></code> gave us a method of navigating the HTML of a static webpage and then <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">selenium</span></code> allowed us to parse dynamically generated pages.</p>
<p>In this notebook, we’ll look at a specialized source of data that we can pull from, Reddit. <a class="reference external" href="http://Reddit.com">Reddit.com</a> is a collection of forums where uses can discuss topics of shared interest. A lot of people use Reddit, so many NLP researchers use it as a place to gather data for novel datasets. In this example, we’ll collect a swathe of text from <a class="reference internal" href="#reddit.com/r/latin"><span class="xref myst">r/latin</span></a> and save it as a CSV.</p>
<p>Over hte past few years, Reddit has made it very difficult to get large chunks of their data. That said, another group, <a class="reference external" href="http://pullpush.io">pullpush.io</a>, have saved and hosted terabytes of histroical Reddit data for public use. We’ll be using their API in this notebook.</p>
<p><strong>Nota Bene</strong>: pullpush’s API service is designed for academic use only! It is an incredible resource, especially because it is free. Please do not abuse it!</p>

<p>Because pullpush is an API service. We will ask for data using an URL. This URL will include information like what subreddit we want to search through, the dates we want to search in, and how the results should be ordered. Se below for an example.</p>
<div class="cell docutils container">
<div class="cell_input docutils container">

<p>Let’s break that down into its component parts:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>*<a class="reference external" href="https://api.pullpush.io/reddit/search/*:">https://api.pullpush.io/reddit/search/*:</a> This part of the URL should never change. This is the base URL that we’ll be adding to depending on our purposes.</p></li>
<li><p><em>submission/</em>: This addition tells pullpsuh that we want to search posts (submissions) and not comments. As we will see later, there is different string that we can use instead that will allow us to search for comments.</p></li>
<li><p><em>?</em>: This question mark is the start of our specific query. It tells pullpush that we are going to be giving it instructions about what data we are expecting to get.</p></li>
<li><p><em>subreddit=latin</em>: This section tells pullpush we want data from the r/latin subreddit. This is very simple but there are many we can nuance this significantly.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>This is the simplest type of query we can run so let’s see what it gives us.</p>

<h2>Collecting Submissions (Posts)<a class="headerlink" href="#collecting-submissions-posts" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h2>
<p>As we can see, each one of these dictionaries from the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">data</span></code> list, holds the information from an individial post. But why are there only 100? Pullpush only allows users to get 100 posts per request, meaning that we’ll have to get creative with how we request data from Pullpush.</p>
<p>To do so we’ll have to take advantage of the other request modifiers besides just “subreddit.” A list of all of these can be found <a class="reference external" href="https://pullpush.io/#docs">here</a>.</p>
<p>One method that we can try is using timestamps to segment the data into chunks less than or equal to 100. Pullpush allows us to ask for posts given a specific time block. We can then loop through these time blocks until we get the data that we want.</p>
<p>Below I’ll walkthrough getting data for a single day. According to the pullpush documentation, there is a “before” and an “after” modeifier, but these only accept an “Epoch value”. What does that mean?</p>

<p>An “epoch value” or Unix Timestamp is a special menthod of encoding dates for computers. It is a standard which represents dates as the number a seconds that have elasped since January 1, 1970. This might seem abritary and that’s because it is! That said we can create a few functions to make translating between normal Python datetime objects and epoch values easier.</p>

<p>Wonderful! Now we have a way to get all of the posts for a single day. Now we can create a loop where we go through every day between a start date and an end date, collecting all of the data in between. To faciliate this we are going to create a generator which does so.</p>
<p>Generators look like functions, but they’re slightly different. Instead of using the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">return</span></code> keyword, an generator using the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">yield</span></code> keyword, which acts like an index in a list. Refer to the example below.</p>

<p>As opposed to the posts, a list of comments like this does not work well with CSV data. CSVs prefer data to be all the “shape” meaning all of the rows have all of the same values. Comments can be tricky because the number of them will always be different, which means it’s impractical to have column for each comment, as we would end of having a lot of empty columns if a certain post gets a large amount of comments.</p>
<p>We can coerce is into a CSV but JSON format would suit this data much better, so we’ll compose a JSON file which has the unique IDs from our DataFrame of posts so that they can be link together.</p>

Sure, I will, but only off the cuff:\n\nWhoever you are, who desire to surpass the classical poets,\nYou are to be educated in the appropriate skills.\nA teacher is at hand: If you follow my instructions\nYou will soon be able to sing melodies, not lacking in praise.\nFirstly, you must take care to read the old poets,\nIf you wish to write verses worthy of Virgil,\nMake sure that you read many poems of Virgil!\nIf you wish to write things apt for lyrical poems,\nMay a poem of Horace sound sweetly in your ear.\nIf, according to your desire, the tear-provoking elegies of Ovid would come to you,\nThe read a lot of Ovid: Ovid will be your teacher.\nBut you will not only be &#39;a book&#39;: writing poems must not be something foreign to you.\nWhen something is to be said by that another poet has already said,\nRemember the sense (of the previous poet), but beware of repeating the (same) words.\n\nIt&#39;s fun to translate- but someone else might do the rest for you?&quot;,

Pretty much everyone who can speak/write Latin well recommends the textbook &quot;Lingua Latina Per Se Illustrata&quot; which is the resource most in line with research on how we acquire languages. You can look in the search to see more tips, but definitely use the Scorpio Martianus recordings on Youtube, definitely reread each multiple times, practice writing/speaking too. You can also look online for general language learning tips like spaced repetition, etc.&#39;,

LLPSI is probably the best resource out there for this.\n\nI did the Latin course on Duolingo, which I&#39;ve found has some marginal benefit, possibly early on in helping me remember verb conjugations much faster, and keeping me in a Latin mindset while I&#39;m out and about, but if I were doing it at home when I could be reading instead, it would be a far less efficient use of my time.\n\nI do have a copy of Wheelock&#39;s Latin, which some people find useful, but personally I feel like using that early on would have made learning Latin unenjoyable.&quot;,

    &#39;body&#39;: &quot;I can&#39;t speak to which textbook is best for learning Latin, but anything that puts a focus on translation, especially by learning grammar rules, will be subpar.\n\nI started reading Lingua Latina per se Illustrata recently, and so far it&#39;s quite good. Most fluent readers (and speakers) of Latin seem to like and recommend it. Though if you don&#39;t find the pure Latin instruction to be quite to your liking, it can be supplemented. Focus has a companion book with additional instruction and grammar in English, which I&#39;ve been using a little. That one however has more mixed reviews and there are definitely other resources that can supplement LLPSI, and people will probably give you recommendations on that front elsewhere in this thread.\n\nEdit: I can&#39;t be certain, but I&#39;m guessing Wheelock&#39;s isn&#39;t a great supplement, compared to materials written specifically to go along with LLPSI. It would probably work fine, though.&quot;,

    &#39;body&#39;: &#39;Happy New Year and Happy Latin-Learning! I would recommend using two books: Lingua Latina Per Se Illustrata and Wheelock’s Latin. The first one will immerse you in Latin from the very first chapter, and lessons are learned through context and reading. The second will give you an in-depth course on the grammar and basic vocabulary of Latin; however, without the practice of LLPSI, Wheelock’s will only take you so far. I highly recommend using both in tandem.&#39;,

    &#39;body&#39;: &#39;I know the book OP is referring to is fiction, but if Ops is referring to the goddess and not the word “ops, opis,” was the worship of Ops actually forbidden/looked down upon, or is Lovecraft just making spooky stories out of nothing? I’ve only been introduced to the Greek gods and as far as I understand, there was nothing wrong with worshipping Rhea?\n\nInscriptions are hard and I haven’t learned much about Roman mythology yet, so nothing about this excerpt immediately makes me think about any one goddess; is there anything in particular in the sentence other than her name that makes you think specifically about Ops? Or do you just have to know your material? I haven’t learned about her so I hadn’t even heard the name; I had no clue. Maybe if I was more knowledgeable about Roman mythology and not just language I would’ve interpreted it differently? The translation you have makes more sense than what I got.&#39;,

    &#39;body&#39;: &#39;Romans love to contract things when they inscribe, frankly it becomes difficult to read even after having studied Latin for a long time and will make most students confused and perhaps self-conscious for their ability. You must study inscriptions independently and you cannot rely on your general Latin as we have seen so far in the thread.\n\nFor Ops it is meant the goddess by the same name, not the regular word ops opis. She is similar to magna mater and is often identified with her. It is good to understand the fluidity to Roman religion before Christianity, gods and goddesses always have varying names and identities. \n\nThe reading is probably all in dative which is typical for inscriptions on buildings, especially thresholds, with the verb absent, “[this building is] for Divine Ops, [who is also] the Great Mother”&#39;,

    &#39;body&#39;: &#39;Haven’t read the book and some of these words aren’t whole (e.g. “DIV” and “MAT”), however it seems to have something to do with Magna Mater and her divinity and power. Here’s a breakdown of the words:\n\n“Div” is likely from “divina, divinae” meaning “divine.” Often used in describing a figure’s divinity.\n“Ops” is probably from “ops, opis” meaning “strength” or “power.”\n“Magna” is from “magna, magnae” meaning “greatness” or “largeness.”\n“Mat” is from “mater, matris,” given the context, meaning “mother.”\n\nThe sentence seems to be saying something about how divine and strong the great mother is. Without the endings, it’s hard to tell exactly what the sentence says, because the root word gives the vocabulary, but the endings tell us the grammar of the word and how exactly it should be used in the sentence. The ancient writing could have said any of these things, for example:\n\n“Divinae ops magna mater” (the powerful great mother of divinity)\n\n“Divina opsque magna mater” (the powerful and divine great mother)\n\n“Divina et ops est magna mater” (divine and powerful is the great mother)\n\n“Divinae ops est magna mater” (powerful is the great mother of divinity)\n\nThe possibilities exceed what’s on this list, however, I think out of these, number 3 makes the most sense because it’s just a general statement of praise/veneration. Marking this in a cellar to indicate dark or forbidden activities having taken place there in the name of that deity is a neat thing to do. I’d take it as kind of a sign of only those in this seemingly forbidden brotherhood were allowed in that place; it’s quite a spooky setting.\n\nAdditionally, I feel like knowing those words and being able to form an idea of what they’re saying but not having a full translation also adds to the terror as vagueness and ambiguity can be horrifying, and that’s kind of what Lovecraft is all about, from what I hear. I suppose it’s the idea of “something terrible happened here, but exactly what, we’ll never know.” Knowing what the worshippers are talking about but not ever knowing what exactly they’re saying or what acts they’ve committed in that place is pretty thrilling! Hope this helps!!\n\nSources:\n\nhttps://en.m.wiktionary.org/wiki/divinus#Latin\nhttps://en.m.wiktionary.org/wiki/ops#Latin\nhttps://en.m.wiktionary.org/wiki/magnus#Latin\nhttps://en.m.wiktionary.org/wiki/mater#Latin\n\nP.S. am on mobile so formatting—blah blah blah.

    &#39;body&#39;: &#39;*Magna Mater* is entirely correct. It means &quot;Great Mother&quot;.\n\n*Diu... ops... magna mat...*:\n\n*Diu* (the v is u) is an an adverb meaning \&#39;continually\&#39;.\n\n*Ops* is a noun meaning strength, power, assistance, or property. In this case it\&#39;s in the nominative singular (subject) case.\n\n*Magna* is the feminine nominative singular adjective for &quot;great&quot;.\n\n*Mat* is not a word I don\&#39;t think. I think it\&#39;s implying it\&#39;s cut off and is *mater*.\n\nIt doesn\&#39;t make much sense to me. Unless I\&#39;m overlooking something this is definitely not a complete sentence. The best intended meaning I could think of is &quot;The great mother is continually strong&quot; or something like that, but it\&#39;s not the right way to say it.&#39;,

    &#39;body&#39;: &#39;The author of this was horrible at Latin. He not only made an obvious mistake, but he also did code-mixing with German to fill in a hole in his Latin knowledge. I am taking some liberties with this, but here is my guess:\n\n“Were married as a public act of penance due to a behind closed doors transgression”\n\nIn the context of the German, “transgressio septi” seems to be a euphemism for extramarital coitus. The mistake in declining “transgressio “ following “ob” seems consistent with someone with poor Latin knowledge inserting a phrase that they consider special. This is a mistake that I would expect from an English speaker rather than a German speaker, but my knowledge of German is almost non-existent, so I am at the limit of my ability to make sense of why the mistake was made beyond doubling back to saying that the author was bad at Latin.\n\nI decided to treat “transgressio” as if it had been properly declined as “transgressionem”. I decided to interpret “septi” as “behind closed doors” because it refers to something enclosed and seems to be some sort of idiom that does not make sense in a literal translation. My decision here was to reinterpret it in a way that fit the context.\n\nI translated “pro” as “as”. This does not seem like a common translation, but it was the possibility that made the most sense. In particular, a priest will often say at the end of confession “for your penance ...”. I interpreted “pro” to have that kind of meaning, such that “as” and “for” are interchangeable and I could take the one that sounds more natural.\n\nI translated “ob” as “due to”. I inserted articles that were absent due to Latin not having them and rearranged the phrases to fit English’s word order. I am relying on on others for the translation of the German to “were married”. It was the last piece needed to make this make sense.\n\nIn the original text, the transgression is emphasized by being placed first. Translating it into English required moving the verb to the front, but doing just that neither seemed to flow well in English nor seemed to convey the original meaning, so I swapped the phrases for the sake of making the translation sound more natural.\n\nThat said, it sounds like they had extramarital coitus, were caught and were forced to marry. The woman might have been pregnant.&#39;,

    &#39;body&#39;: &quot;Two forthcoming translations from Latin accepted for publication as books- one contract already signed (just a few days ago), the other one still at the &#39;expect the contract very soon&#39; stage. Both should come out before the end of 2020. Another publication due to come out through Brepols, too, sometime in 2020.\n\nBut, as for new work this year- I&#39;m planning on finding the most strange hagiographical work I can, and getting it translated and accepted for publication. I mean, a really, really strange hagiography.... one that a reader of science fiction or gothic fiction would like. I&#39;ve got a few possibilities in mind, but any suggestions would be welcome.&quot;,

The plural _scriptūrae, -ārum_ is used to denote the Bible as a whole, since it includes many books; the singular _scriptūra, -ae_ sometimes means “a passage front the Bible”.\n\n2. _’Ahl al-Kitāb_ includes Jews and Christians and, depending on who you ask, Gnostics, Zoroastrians and Hindus. If you want to remark that they are many peoples using a plural _nātiōnēs_ or _gentēs_, you should specify that they don’t believe all in the same exact Scriptures, and hence a plural _scriptūrae, -ārum_,&#39;,

This would suggest that it originated in Old English, which Wikipedia claims Albert Baugh defined as being from 450 AD to 1150 AD. It would be difficult to get a more precise date than that.

Japanese uses 3 syllables for itself and 2 syllables for English. The last syllable in each means “language”. There really is not any need for a way to shorten the name of a language when it is already at the length of 2 to 3 syllables. That is already in line with the shortened forms that English and Spanish use. It is hard to imagine it being practical to make the names any shorter.&#39;,

What I meant here was that to me, it\&#39;s more of a peculiarty of Latin that it lacks a productive strategy to convert modifiers (adjectives) specifying nouns meaning &quot;language&quot; into standalone proper nouns. Slavic languages have such a strategy - the same old straightforward conversion, keeping the gender of their word for &quot;language&quot;, and Romanian borrows that, while in other Romance languages the gender seems to be fixed as masculine (not sure if their speakers feel the ellipsis of any particular noun, but it\&#39;s definitely not the one descended from *lingua*). In the more official contexts, all of them seem to use a noun phrase with *lingua*. Celtic languages seem to do the same as Slavic ones - as far as I can see, adjective-derived language names all agree in gender with [the word for &quot;language&quot;](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Reconstruction:Proto-Celtic/tangʷāss).&#39;,

Language names are one of the most obvious examples. The word “good” is another.\n\nThat being said, Chinese and Japanese both mimic Latin in the manner in which they name languages.

    &#39;body&#39;: &#39;Actually it seems to me that not having a way to refer to languages with one handy adjective without syntactic restrictions is the less common situation, certainly among European languages. The thing is, as far as I understand what that person is saying, they understand that the 1-word/full phrase equivalence is peculiar to English. The logic of what they\&#39;re doing seems to be:\n\nputting a forgeign-language phrase into an English sentence allows one to apply English grammar rules to it, because the words you\&#39;re manipulating are actually English words magically encoded to be Latin, and as long as you can decode them back into English, you\&#39;re good to go. E.g. in the Latin phrase *lingua latīna,* *lingua* is code=Latin for &quot;language&quot;, and *latīna* code=Latin for &quot;Latin&quot;. But you must not overtly decode code=Latin into English (e.g. write &quot;Latin&quot; for the starting *Latīna*), because otherwise what\&#39;s the point of learning to decode it in the first place? And that was the reason behind their original correction of &quot;Latin&quot; into *Latina.* The word must look like Latin, but be English underlyingly.\n\nThey assume everybody else also thinks this way. I don\&#39;t think it\&#39;s metalinguistic ignorance, I think it\&#39;s neural pathway corruption leading to inability to disambiguate languages caused by grammar-translation. I\&#39;ve seen similar enough cases before.&#39;,

    &#39;body&#39;: &#39;I used to be like him. Hopefully, he will figure it out at some point that a single word name is a quirk of English that other languages do not necessarily share. Chinese for example is called “middle language” in Chinese. If you just write “middle”, it makes no sense in a very obvious way. It is the same in Latin, except it is not obvious to us English speakers when looking at the name of Latin in Latin because we are used to that quirk of English. It is more obvious when looking at the Chinese word for Chinese because we do not call it “middle language”, so just writing “middle” immediately feels wrong.&#39;,

    &#39;body&#39;: &#39;English allows the term Latin to be used as a noun, but Latin does not. Lingua Latina is the short version of the name of Latin in Latin. Drop Lingua and it makes no sense because Latina is a pure adjective. As far as a reader knows, you could be talking about Latin Art when you just say “Latina” by itself. There is no association with the word language unless you say the word language.&#39;,

    &#39;body&#39;: &#39;I literally think you\&#39;ve managed to confuse English and Latin into one language somehow. *Lingua Latīna* is the Latin equivalent for the English &quot;the Latin language&quot; or just &quot;Latin&quot;. I don\&#39;t know whether Latin was called &quot;Latīna&quot; at any stage of English, but if just for the sake of argument it was called that in Old English - the OP most definitely wasn\&#39;t asking what Latin was called in Old English. In fact, the time reference is 300 BC, when **Proto-Germanic** hadn\&#39;t even taken its definite shape yet.\n\nThe only way the OP makes sense if we assume they were asking what **ancient Romans** called Latin, **in Latin**. &quot;Latina&quot; is not what they called it in Latin, &quot;Lingua Latīna&quot; is what they did call it in Latin. \nThe only way what you\&#39;re saying makes sense to me is if you\&#39;re taking the Latin phrase &quot;Lingua Latīna&quot;, imagining that it\&#39;s English, then applying the grammatical transformation you would have used to convert &quot;the Latin language&quot; into &quot;Latin&quot; in English, **to the Latin phrase**. Then you proceed to imply there are some &quot;we&quot; who do that on a regular basis. It\&#39;s completely surreal to me.\n\nYou do realise that English grammar and vocabulary belongs to English, and not to Latin, which does just fine with its own?&#39;,

    &#39;body&#39;: &#39;**Proto-Italic language**\n\nThe Proto-Italic language is the ancestor of the Italic languages, most notably Latin and its descendants, the Romance languages. It is not directly attested in writing, but has been reconstructed to some degree through the comparative method. Proto-Italic descended from the earlier Proto-Indo-European language.\n\n***\n\n^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&amp;amp;message=Excludeme&amp;amp;subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/latin/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot)   ^]\n^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28&#39;,

    &#39;body&#39;: &quot;Every language comes from an earlier language. Roughly speaking, we call the language that Latin came from [Proto-Italic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proto-Italic_language). We&#39;re talking pre-1000 BCE. I have no idea what the speakers of that language called it (probably lots of different things, as varieties of it were spoken by people of many, many different groups of people). And since this was before writing was invented, we have no way of knowing what the names they used for their language were.\n\nYou may find the Wikipedia article on the [History of Latin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Latin#Origins) useful.&quot;,

I hear those, who are obviously ashamed of Christ and the words of Christ, to have so \&#39;white-washed\&#39; his severity -this is when you were with us- that they say it is of no concern to enquire how a person is living in relation to (their receiving sacramentally) the Body and Blood of Christ. Hence it is that you have done something with the abbot of St. Albans (about this issue), so that a serious effort be made at understanding how something so contrary to the principles of Christianity could so prevail, if the people be permitted to succumb to such an error.&quot;\n\n\nArguably, very pertinent for our own times!!&#39;,

Therefore, even you yourself with the abbot of Saint Alban have managed to achieve something...&quot;\n\nThe &quot;Quid autem?&quot; at the beginning could mean a number of things depending on what came before in the text; &quot;pallio&quot; should come from &quot;pallium&quot; (a sort of cape) and should therefore mean &quot;to cover with a cape&quot;, &quot;to dissimulate&quot;, &quot;to hide&quot;; as I said I have not much of a clue as to what &quot;ut&quot; or &quot;velut&quot; do in the last sentence so my attempt stops short of them.&#39;,

That is, however, a particular verb, as it only has perfect forms (and derived), the future imperative and, rarely, the present participle. An easier, and regular, yet deponent, synonym is the verb *recordōr*/*recordāri*, which has the same meaning.&quot;,

    &#39;body&#39;: &#39;You’re right. When I wrote “error”, I just meant a spelling we would regard as an error, even if it was not seen as such at his time.\n\nAs for _epistola_, apparently this spelling is found in Cicero and Svetonius, so it’s definitely not an error. I thought Dante used _epistola_ because that is the word in Italian (derived from _epistula_ with regular sound change /u/ &amp;gt; /o/), but it’s more likely that he chose it to imitate the aforementioned authors (I don’t think he was imitating the Greek spelling, as he couldn’t speak or read Greek).&#39;,

    &#39;body&#39;: &quot;I wouldn&#39;t necessarily call all of those spellings errors. Pronunciation changes, and spelling can change to reflect that. There&#39;s nothing incorrect about that. In fact, the word *epistula* was originally the Greek word *epistolē* (*ἐπιστολή*), so one might even say that *epistola* is more correct than *epistula*.\n\nOn the other hand, I&#39;ll grant you that *Pyeria* is a different case. That spelling does not reflect a change in the pronunciation of the word, but a misunderstanding of how the word was pronounced at an earlier point in time.\n\nStill, if a spelling like *Pyeria* was common in Dante&#39;s time, I think it&#39;s a but too strong to call it an error. People at that time weren&#39;t necessarily being sloppy. They just didn&#39;t have the etymological knowledge that we now have.&quot;,

If you look at prayers of this type, they\&#39;re a mixture of hortatory subjunctives and imperatives. (See, e.g. the Pater noster.) But the English here is an imperative. Just change one term and it\&#39;ll be a bit more obvious: &quot;God save me!&quot; \n\nPlus there are actual historical parallels for the phrase in the form of the hymn [*Domine salvum fac regem*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domine_salvum_fac_regem).

I hope that you understand that Latin was a spoken language at some point and it had colloquial uses and expressions. You and others here simply misunderstand what quod means as a word and its function in sentences, and you rely too much on your grammar books to think for yourselves. Non sum quod fui is four words that are legible and easy. I am not sure how there is so much wrong discussion here.&#39;,

    &#39;body&#39;: &#39;Comma use in Latin is not consistent. Commas usage was not standardized till the modern period, and different European languages follow different rules. People who write Latin nowadays usually follow the rules of their own native language, but they don\&#39;t have to. In the German system, every subordinate clause is separated off by commas. Some people who write Latin use that system. So that may be the reason the comma is here, not a distinction between different sorts of clauses.\n\nI think the Latin here is not necessarily that good. My natural inclination is to read it &quot;I am not what I was&quot; just because that makes more sense, particularly in the literary context \\[just read the surrounding English and you\&#39;ll see what I mean\\], than &quot;I am not because I was.&quot;  But I think a native Latin speaker would probably render &quot;I am not what I was&quot; as &quot;non sum qui fui&quot; or, maybe, &quot;non sum is qui fui&quot; or &quot;non sum qualis fui&quot; or &quot;non sum idem qui fui.&quot;  I think there\&#39;s some English calque in this Latin. It seems un-Latin to use the neuter &quot;quod&quot; to refer to an animate (presumably male) being.  In other words, we have here an English-language sentiment \\[&quot;I am not what I was&quot;\\] clumsily (incorrectly?)  translated into Latin and preserving inappropriate English idiom.&#39;,

    &#39;body&#39;: &#39;Thank you for your help. I am sorry that you were offended by the statement that my teacher doesn\&#39;t teach--it clearly resonates with you deeply and your rant is most likely reflective of some inner tensions. However, that statement is unfortunately shockingly accurate and is supported by nearly every student in the classroom. Our classroom activities consist of the class struggling through a translation without any support or guidance from the teacher (on the contrary students are sarcastically ridiculed), and then being tested on concepts outside the few materials we are given. Any attempts to seek help from the teacher generally result in being guilt tripped or attacked passive aggressively. While I recognize the validity of your argument that saying &quot;my teacher doesn\&#39;t teach&quot; helps no one, your assumptions about me based off of that statement are completely unfounded. On the contrary, it is clear that by coming onto reddit asking for help, I am taking initiative and responsibility for my own learning. I am not merely saying I don\&#39;t understand, but am providing specific conceptual weaknesses that I would like to address. Finally, I go to a highly competitive public school where teachers usually get tenure after 2 years, and are VERY well paid relative to the national average, so I doubt that they take a teaching job just because they love teaching (it might be the only job available for someone with a obscure degree in the humanities)--if that was the case, maybe my teacher wouldn\&#39;t be so unpleasant to deal with (they do have personal issues but they shouldn\&#39;t prevent the teacher from doing their job). Regardless, I appreciate the time you took to provide me with some life advice. I am grateful for it.\n\n&amp;amp;#x200B;\n\nBlue&#39;,

    &#39;body&#39;: &#39;&amp;gt;my teacher doesn´t teach\n\nThis isn\&#39;t a helpful framing to address your challenges because...\n\n1. It\&#39;s almost certain that your teacher *does* teach. If they have tenure at at school in the US, they have bare minimum standards they must meet. If they\&#39;re at a school without a tenure system or haven\&#39;t earned tenure yet, they are subject to even more scrutiny.\n2. It places the burden for your learning on the teacher, not where it should be - *on you*. There\&#39;s no debate about this issue in the research. If students want to learn, *they* have to do the intellectual heavy-lifting. Teaching is a process that supports them in those efforts, not the primary vehicle for accomplishing them.\n3. It obscures the conversation that you *should* be having with your teacher right now. If this is how you actually feel, you **need** to communicate it to them in a productive way, e.g. &quot;I appreciate the efforts you\&#39;re putting in to help us understand this material, but I still find myself confused and not quite following what you\&#39;re doing when you \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_. In the past, I found that when you did \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_, it was clear and more helpful to me. Could we incorporate more learning activities like that into this class? If not, could you suggest some resources or habits for me to use on my own to help?&quot;\n\nTeachers don\&#39;t keep teaching if they *don\&#39;t* want their students to succeed. It\&#39;s *way* too much work, time, energy, and - frankly - bullshit to deal with for way too little compensation. They are invested in your success, but attaining that means you need to communicate with them about what is/isn\&#39;t working for you and why. The first step to doing that successfully is adopting a mindset and language that doesn\&#39;t (1) minimize what others are doing to try and help, even if it\&#39;s not working *for you* (it may be working very well for others!); (2) accurately recognizes the collaborative nature of learning and your role in it; and (3) works to build bridges and solve problems.\n\nThat last part is especially important. Teachers hear &quot;I don\&#39;t understand&quot; dozens of times every.single.day. That statement in itself is ***not*** helpful, since it doesn\&#39;t offer any clue about *what* you\&#39;re not understanding, *how* you\&#39;re thinking about the information, or *any* frame of reference about things that *have* worked to help find a more successful approach. Sorry for the avuncular tone, but after a decade of hearing students say this in one form or another, I\&#39;m past just nodding and have moved on to intervening, since &quot;my teacher doesn\&#39;t teach&quot; as a critique helps literally ***no one*** \\- not you, not your classmates, not your teacher, and not even random strangers on the internet like me.&#39;,

Whether you translate as after or when, it&#39;s still temporal/circumstancial (indicative/subjunctive respectively).\n\nEdit: To clarify, there are other types of cum clauses that translate differently.&quot;,

    &#39;body&#39;: &quot;Cum works in that way when used as alternatives to postquam and dum with indiciative, it&#39;s a very important little detail since the subjunctive imperfect expresses that something essentially happens at the same time and therefore during while the perfect expresses something later equal to postquam.\n\nHence the common expressions like cum pervenisset (when/after he got there)\n\nOr e.g. Cum maneret (while he was waiting)\n\nIn sentences with subjunctives the tenses completely dictate the meaning to the point were the slightest difference in tense can change the meaning or cause a sentence to be grammatically wrong.&quot;,

    &#39;body&#39;: &quot;Yes, the masculine form of the adjective is always the first form listed, and sometimes the only form listed. So in dictionaries you&#39;ll see either:\n\n**altus, -a, -um** high, deep. \n\n**acer, cris, cre** sharp, sour.\n\nOr:\n\n**altus** high, deep. \n\n**acer, cris, cre** sharp, sour.\n\nOr:\n\n**altus, alta, altum** high, deep. \n\n**acer, acris, acre** sharp, sour.\n\nThe different paradigms will become more apparent as you study the language. That being said, by convention the masculine nominative form of the adjective is the first one listed, then the feminine nom (if different from the masculine), then the neuter nom (if different from the previous two). \n\nAlso by convention, Latin dictionaries list firstly the nominative and then the genitive forms of the noun, and marks for the appropriate gender with either m, f or n. For example:\n\n**abacus, ci** m. abacus.\n\n**abies, etis** f. silver fir, tree of the species *abies alba*.\n\nOr:\n\n**abacus, abaci** m. abacus.\n\n**abies, abietis** f. silver fir, tree of the species *albies alba.*&quot;,

Perhaps this obviousness is the reason it remained unnoticed for so long, or perhaps it can\&#39;t really be distinguished from the &quot;interruped imperfect&quot;.&#39;,

What I like about LTRL is the large number of practice sentences and grammar drills in each chapter that really make sure you &quot;get&quot; a concept before moving on. Also the second half of the book has hundreds of longer readings of prose and poetry passages from classical authors.&#39;,

    &#39;body&#39;: &#39;Quonam itself is an adverb that means “to whatever place.” So basically just a more emphatic “where.” \n\nAnd the difference between those is that “where are you going?” is a complete statement. But “where you are going” would be a clause that’s part of a larger sentence like “where you are going is dangerous.” It doesn’t stand alone as its own sentence. So that would help you decipher which way to translate it along with context clues&#39;,

    &#39;body&#39;: &#39;Hummm.... So would there be a case where you would say quonam?  Also, &quot;where&quot; could mean 2 different things, depending on wether we use a &quot;?&quot; or not at the end, and the position of &quot;are&quot; and &quot;you&quot;. \n\nWhere are you going? \n\nWhere you are going\n\nWould you the use quonam in one of these cases? ...

    &#39;body&#39;: &#39;No, “quo vadis” is grammatically correct. “Quo” in that case is used as an adverb meaning “where.” “Quo vadis” is already an interrogative. \n\nThe use of “-ne” is for instances when an interrogative adverb is not used. For example, if you want to ask someone if they are walking to the forest, you would need to add “-ne” to the verb. “ambulas ad silvam” means “you are walking to the forest.” But “ambulasne ad silvam” means “are you walking to the forest?” \n\n“-ne” is added to a verb. “-nam” is sometimes added to an adjective or pronoun. “-nam” is to add emphasis but isn’t necessary in an interrogative&#39;,

Didactic texts should have both macrons and stress accents (traupman\&#39;s book does this), not-no students miss-stress words because they chant forms with the stress on the termination.  \n  \nSpelling: I think there is room for fun in latin spelling. I prefer the pronunciation-transparent ji spelling of compounds of jacio e.g. adjicio vs adicio. Prefer classical ti/ci distinction, have a fondness for incorrect usages of œ and æ (fœmina, prælium), heavily dislike mpn for mn (e.g. dampnum, sompnus for damnum, somnus). No opinion on misplaced y or h (though in the solitary case of &quot;lacrima&quot;, I prefer &quot;lachryma&quot;). Nichil and michi to be avoided.  \n  \nCapitals: As english: proper nouns and sentence beginnings.  \n  \n*(for those unfamiliar: circumflex = long vowel (usually reserved for ambiguity), grave accent distinguished adverb e.g. quòd (because) vs quod (which thing), acute accent = enclitic or unusual stress (e.g. caritative (charitably) vs caritatíve (caritati + -ve))&#39;,

    &#39;body&#39;: &quot;I can deal with only using U and I, what I really don&#39;t like is when V is used and J is not. I think it became a standard in modern printed Latin and even Vicipaedia somehow because the Vatican stopped using the letter J (since they don&#39;t use J in Italian either), but not only I think that texts look so much more aesthetically pleasing with both V and J, it is also way more helpful for teaching books to make pronunciation absolutely clear.&quot;,

Just some examples for nouns that makes things pretty recognizable:\n\n* The genitive plural is typically a \&#39;X-rum\&#39; - arum, orum, um, uum, erum.\n* The (m/f) accusative is always 2 letters ending with \&#39;m\&#39; - am, um, em, um, em.\n* Dative/accusative/ablative plurals take a &quot;1-2-1&quot; pattern: e.g., is-as-is; is-os-is; ibus-es-ibus.&#39;,

    &#39;body&#39;: &#39;If your goal is to read the Vulgate, the absolute best resource is Lingua Latina Per Se Illustrata and you should prioritize reading that far more than the advice I gave regarding speaking/writing.\n\nThe Vulgate (especially the NT) is among the &quot;easiest&quot; of &quot;real&quot; Latin texts, especially if you have familiarity with the Bible in another language so your goal is quite reasonable and can be achieved in a quick pace if you are dedicated. I don\&#39;t know what your current experience is, but someone with no prior experience working intensively with LLPSI can get to reading the vulgate within perhaps three months. Your required time will be even less if you already have some exposure to the language. \n\nLLPSI works in line with how Second Language Acquisition works; it is entirely in Latin and gradually works its way up from the simplest of sentences (Roma in Italia est) to adapted passages from Latin literature (including passages from the Vulgate). If someone is learning English, for example, we wouldn\&#39;t simply teach them the grammar and give them Shakespeare; we would slowly ramp up the difficulty and give them a large *quantity* of input that they can understand. It does take a large *quantity* of level-appropriate reading to internalize a language and LLPSI is to my knowledge the only text designed specifically for this purpose. So LLPSI will build you to the level of reading the Vulgata and fits your purpose quite nicely.\n\nYou could of course simply open up the Vulgate, get an English translation, a grammar book, and a dictionary, and grind through each sentence slowly word-by-word; but this is slow and laborious, and besides, doesn\&#39;t get you to a place where you are understanding the Vulgate natively in Latin. If your goal is to *read* the Vulgate, and not merely *decode* it, you do need a lot of practice reading easier texts with gradually increasing difficulty. If you progress at a rate of one chapter per day you will be through LLPSI in a little over a month and ready to begin reading the gospels.\n\nedit: To be clear, what I have recommended here will specifically help you to read the Vulgate. If you do not have time for an intensive pace it will take longer, but still, LLPSI will be the quickest path there. If you are interested in reading Christian philosophical and theological texts these can be quite difficult and will require much more time which the second Lingua Latina book will help with (but for the Vulgate it is not strictly necessary, though it might help). These texts might also require some knowledge of important Roman philosophers/writers, especially Cicero, Seneca, Vergil, and Ovid who tend to get cited a lot, and are more difficult than the Vulgate.&#39;,

The Lingua Latina Per Se Illustrata series is best for reading; as for writing or speaking you can either practice with other people or practice on your own, gradually increasing the complexity as you feel comfortable. You can use either a grammar book or online tools like wiktionary when you get stuck. Many people would suggest you to simply memorize the tables, though this won’t really internalize it without substantial reading and writing practice and is quite rote and boring.&#39;,

    &#39;body&#39;: &#39;If you have studied other languages and aren\&#39;t averse to learning grammar, I would highly recommend starting with &quot;Learn to Read Latin&quot; by Keller and Russell. I used it for intensive self study between August and November last year (starting from scratch), and am now taking 4th semester Latin at my college. I\&#39;ve been able to read Ovid, Vergil and Cicero fairly easily, and I can translate at sight any Latin passages/quotes that come up in early modern philosophy texts (with dictionary help of course).\n\nInitially you\&#39;ll need to do all the workbook exercises which are made-up sentences, and preferably read them twice over. After you learn participles in Chapter 10, the book transitions to fewer made-up passages and much longer unadapted prose and poetry readings. It is quite expensive, and you do need the workbook which has a copious amount of exercises, but it is totally worth it if you want a structured experience where you know what you are learning.\n\nLingua Latina is good as a supplementary text, but it can be quite slow if you don\&#39;t find the story interesting. Now that I\&#39;ve studied grammar and reading by other means, I am joining a LLPSI reading group at my school starting with the later chapters (25+) and Roma Aeterna.&#39;,

The normal active participle form was used. So *moriens* would be a correct nominative participle.\n\nStill, if I&#39;m not mistaken, Latin originally used a separate ending *-bundus* to create present participles of deponent verbs. A few of those survived in classical Latin, such as *vagabundus* from *vagari*, and *moribundus* from *mori*. But they were no longer treated as the participles of those verbs, just as adjectives derived from those verbs.\n\nSimilarly confusing, by the way, the gerundive of a deponent verb actually has passive meaning.&quot;,

Stultus is the most common, the most authentical ; ineptus not much less, and maybe the most appropriate for your situation. Both are very common in Plautine comedy, so I would advise you to choose between them.&#39;,

    &#39;body&#39;: &#39;In English, a noun can have two forms, more accurately known as cases: the first is the plain one you see in the dictionary, the second is a genitive case that adds -\&#39;s to the end of the noun to show that it owns something. For example, *dad* is the nominative (plain) case, while *dad\&#39;s* is in the possessive case. There\&#39;s also the plural forms: *dads* is nominative, *dads\&#39;* is possessive.\n\nIn Latin, there are these two cases, but there\&#39;s three others: the dative, accusative, and ablative. The dative is used for the indirect object, such as &quot;the boy&quot; in the following sentence:  \nI gave the ball *to the boy.*\n\nThe nominative is the subject of the sentence just like in English, while the accusative case is the direct object of the sentence:  \nThe man(subject) sees the dog(object).  \nNote that, in English, you put the direct object after the verb. In Latin, because you give it a special case ending, you already know it\&#39;s the direct object. This means you can put it pretty much anywhere you want without changing the meaning of the sentence!\n\nThe ablative is used for all sorts of things, mainly prepositions like &quot;in&quot; or &quot;on.&quot; The genitive, dative, and accusative also have further uses beyond what I\&#39;ve said, but not nearly as many as the ablative does.&#39;,

    &#39;body&#39;: &#39;Latinus sermo is another way to say &quot;lingua Latina&quot; and if you learnt Latin by translating the old Latin authors you will find out that expressions like &quot;Latinus sermo&quot; or &quot;Graecus sermo&quot; are more widespread than &quot;lingua Latina&quot; or &quot;lingua Graeca&quot;. However saying &quot;lingua Latina&quot; is correct too. &quot;Sermo&quot; is a masculine name of the third declension (maybe that &quot;-o&quot; made you think it was an ablative or you thought it was a neuter substantive) and the subjet of this sentence so the adjective &quot;Latinus&quot; must be also masculine and nomative. &quot;Iucundus est&quot; is a nominal predicate so &quot;iucundus&quot; must be nominative and masculine too. &quot;Est&quot; is the action of the subject which is singular, not me and you, but another so we have to choose the third person of present indicative of &quot;sum&quot; which means &quot;I am&quot; (the verbs in Latin vocabulary are not written in their infinitive form as it happens in the modern languages), and it\&#39;s at the end of the phrase because if you read old Latin authors you realize that verbs are always at the end of the sentence, except in rare cases, but that is not wrong. Latin isn\&#39;t like English: having conjugations the subject can be removed and having the declensions the position of the words is more free because the cases define their role in the phrase. In English subject can\&#39;t be removed because all the verbs have the same ending and we would not understand who made the action and also you must respect their position in the sentence if you want to be understood.&#39;,

    &#39;body&#39;: &#39;Both of those mean &quot;eternal and at any time&quot; which I doubt is what you mean. The reality is that &quot;forever and ever&quot; is objectively just an odd construction, and the only reason it makes sense to us is because we hear it a lot and know what it\&#39;s supposed to mean. To get the same meaning across into Latin, you could just say &quot;*semper*,&quot; which just means, &quot;always,&quot; or you could use the phrase &quot;*in aeternum*,&quot; or, literally, &quot;into eternal.&quot; I have also seen &quot;*in saecula saeculorum*&quot; and &quot;*per omnia saecula saeculorum*,&quot; which mean, respectively, &quot;into the ages of ages&quot; and &quot;through all the ages of ages.&quot; Personally, the latter would be my choice for an elegant translation that captures the infiniteness of &quot;forever and ever&quot; in English.&#39;,

    &#39;body&#39;: &quot;You have the right idea, but you will get better at really reading by *really reading*, not by struggling through things that you are not yet ready for, and even the simplest Latin authors are simple only for those with a  decent reading level (which means those with a mastery of the forms, a large vocabulary, and plenty of experience with even simpler Latin). What you need to find are things that you can read comfortably *without* a dictionary, or with very little recourse to one, and then you need to read as much as you possibly can.\n\nNo author&#39;s works really fit this bill, so your best bet is to read through the passages from any beginner&#39;s Latin textbooks you can get access to, as well as Latin &#39;readers&#39;, i.e., books written with the design of giving students extra reading practice. Some easy readers can be found here: http://hiberna-cr.wikidot.com/reading-material&quot;,

    &#39;body&#39;: &#39;If you haven\&#39;t used the Lingua Latina Per Se Illustrata books, it is an essential resource for what you are describing--the goal being to get learners to be able to read texts, not just translating them via grammar knowledge.\n\nThe problem with reading &quot;real&quot; Latin is the lack of intermediate level texts that can serve as a bridge for beginners. The LLPSI series will help with that; there are also readers made in the late 19th/early 20th century which are designed with the same goal in mind (Ad Alpes is one, but there are plenty, in varying quality).\n\nAs for advanced authors, some are harder than others and a lot will depend on your own background. If you know a lot of Hellinstic philosophy, Cicero and Seneca\&#39;s philosophical works will come more easily; maybe you don\&#39;t have a good background in Roman history and politics and so Cicero\&#39;s speeches might come harder. Conversely perhaps you are well versed in Medieval or Renaissance periods and those texts may be easier for you; they tend to be a bit simpler Latin-wise, though sometimes can have some oddities here and there. Above all, the more you read of an author the easier their work gets. In my mind, Cicero\&#39;s philosophy and Livy\&#39;s history marks as good a starting point as any because they both have very clear styles; Caesar is often recommended as a first author because his extremely compact style is easier to translate, but from a perspective of *reading*, in my opinion he is more difficult than relatively clear authors; besides, Cicero\&#39;s style became the thing-to-imitate and so exposure to that will make it easier to read the authors he influences.\n\nedit: I somehow forgot, but Nepos is perhaps the easiest Classical author; very accessible and quite good too!&#39;,

    &#39;body&#39;: &#39;As always, the Vulgate—its Latin is babby-tier in comparison with Classical texts. Then I recommend Saint Isidore’s _Etymologies_ for some extremely varied and basically inexhaustible reading. No matter what catches your interest, you’ll find it in that book. Then, for something more obscure, I enjoy _Dē verbōrum significātiōne_, Paul the Deacon’s epitome of Sextus Pompeius Festus’ epitome of Verrius Flaccus’ great lexicographic work, where you’ll find some quite unique ‘stories about words’, discussion about archaic Latin, obscure _hapax legomena_ and quotations from old forgotten authors. Definitely of more marginal interest but I think that if you’re learning Latin you’re the kind of person who’d savour that.\n\nNow, on to the Classical period, Catullus is easy, enjoyable and, since he’s so widely taught, has a lot of resources (on Perseus Tufts you can find a completely literal English translation—I wish there was something like this for more texts). Then, Ovid is approachable as well but definitely more difficult already, and, I think this is an unpopular opinion, Juvenal is actually an okay author for intermediate readers: he is very fun to read too—the difficulty lies not in grammar, but in his cryptic way of expressing himself and his nigh-incoherence, difficulties  which a Loeb parallel text edition should alleviate.\n\n(By the way, use loebclassics.com for a rich catalogue of Latin—and Greek—texts with parallel translations (reasonably literal), a limited critical apparatus and helpful annotations and introductions.

There might be another library somewhere that does something like that, but I can&#39;t think of one offhand.\n\nI&#39;m looking at the library&#39;s page for Vat. Lat. 10696. The page mentions that it&#39;s from Livy, that it&#39;s sec (sic!) IV-V, and also includes a rather large bibliography. But as far as I can see, it doesn&#39;t mention that this fragment of Livy is XXXIV, 36-39. Now, probably most people who went to Vatican website looking for Vat. Lat. 10696 would already know that it&#39;s XXXIV, 36-39. Still, it wouldn&#39;t have taken up all that much room on the page to mention it. The information might have been helpful if some beginner had just stumbled across this while browsing the library&#39;s website.&quot;,

    &#39;body&#39;: &quot;You can think of an indirect statement as the object of a verb, but it does not follow that you can use an indirect statement as the object of *any* transitive verb. You wouldn&#39;t have one after, say, *aedificare* or *movere* or *pulsare* -- *cogitare* likewise.\n\nHowever you think of it, this verb just is *not* found with acc. + inf. among the classical authors. I think that&#39;s the example we should follow.\n\nIt&#39;s hard for us as English speakers, because we learn that this verb means &#39;to think&#39; and so we suppose that it is therefore basically synonymous with *putare* and operates with the same syntax. It was years before I learnt that it was otherwise, and for some it takes even longer: you will find it used with acc. + inf. in the *Harrius Potter* books, whose translator, Peter Needham, taught Latin at Eton for thirty years under this misapprehension.&quot;,

If you&#39;ve made it through intro Latin, I&#39;m sure you&#39;re no stranger to memorization.  That said, if you want to really learn to read Latin, you need to start yourself on a reading program with a massive amount of input (well beyond what you will read in undergrad) of texts at a lower-level than Roman literature.

    &#39;body&#39;: &#39;I would say no.\n\nThe neuter gender mostly refers to inanimate things. The only exception I can think of is _scortum_ “harlot” – which looks really dehumanizing.\n\nThe Latin gender system derives from Indoeuropean, which originally distinguished animate for people and inanimate for abstract concepts. The animate gender split into masculine and feminine, the inanimate gender became what is known as neuter. \n\nA non-binary person is not an object, so using neuter would be inappropriate. I’d use either masculine or feminine depending on their preferences.&#39;,

    &#39;body&#39;: &#39;This is coming from a different language perspective so it might not be super applicable, but it is a language with three genders (Russian - M, F, N) that I\&#39;m a native speaker of, and I am one of the elsewhere-mentioned &quot;unlikely gender-neutral people&quot;, so it\&#39;s some kind of insight for sure.\n\nIMO using N-gender for a person would indeed be dehumanizing/infantilizing. From what I\&#39;ve seen of how fellow Russian-speaking nonbinary people deal with things, they usually choose M or F for themselves, with different rationales. Some people use opposite-to-their-biological-sex pronouns to hammer home that they\&#39;re not the gender they were assigned at birth, others use the gender corresponding to some other noun they feel fits them (eg. &quot;person&quot; is masculine, so they use masculine for themselves), etc.\n\nIf you\&#39;re looking to refer to someone in third person in a text, it\&#39;s probably best to get around pronouns altogether by consistently using &quot;that person&quot; or something to that effect. And asking the person in question would be the best call, for sure.&#39;,

    &#39;body&#39;: &#39;Some classicists say “yes” because neuter does not have the implications that “it” does in English (ne+uter= not either). Those classicists, however, in my experience, have all been cis, so take it with a grain of salt. Your best bet, imo, is to just ask someone, just like English. \n\nIf they don’t know Latin, you may just have to quickly be like “technically it doesn’t have the dehumanization of English, but I get why that still might not be acceptable to you.”\n\nI just wouldn’t, like, assign someone pronouns or something.&#39;,

Those entries appear to go on to say where and when (like the village and the church) but the handwriting is really hard to read at this small size.

The couple were required to announce their intentions two or three times so other community members could raise any objections to the marriage. Marriage registers sometimes give the two or three dates on which the marriage intentions were announced in addition to the marriage date. &quot;\n\nThat\&#39;s why it says tribus bannis!  After having announced their intentions the customary three times, they were wed.&#39;,

    &#39;body&#39;: &#39;I\&#39;m not talented enough at Latin itself to comment on technical translation, but you might have better luck brainstorming some more metaphorical ways to describe what you\&#39;re actually doing -- Rolling dice in order to determine who goes first.  Speaking as a guy that works primariy in marketing, &quot;Roll for  Initiative&quot; isn\&#39;t quite the kind of Motto I think you\&#39;re looking for -- it\&#39;s more of a call to action or a command. Might want to try something along these lines:  \n\n&quot;Fate dictates primacy&quot; (this one might be the easiest to translate)  \n\n&quot;First by Fortune&quot;  \n\nWith mottos, to me, it\&#39;s best to stay away from any specific language about action -- The U.S. Motto isn\&#39;t &quot;One Nation of Many Peoples&quot;, it\&#39;s &quot;Out of many, One&quot;.  \n\nDeconstruct what you want to say to the barest, minimalist bones possible and then work from there! :)&#39;,

    &#39;body&#39;: &#39;&quot;Volvo&quot; is not the correct verb in this situation. &quot;Alea iacta est&quot;, which you mentioned, is a very good starting point. In greek it\&#39;s Ἀνερρίφθω κύβος (Anerríftho kúbos), &quot;the dice has been thrown&quot;, where the verbs iacio and ρίπτω (rípto) refer precisely to the movement of the dice being thrown and hitting the surface. So, let\&#39;s start with &quot;iactate&quot;. It\&#39;s harder to transalte &quot;for initiative&quot;, because latin has a lot of options to express finality, and &quot;initiative&quot; is obviously an alien concept for the culture.\n&quot;Initiative&quot; is both &quot;the start of the combat&quot; and &quot;the order of the combat&quot;. I think the first option sounds better in latin, so let\&#39;s go with that.\nI think &quot;Alea iactate incipiendo proelio&quot; or &quot;Alea iactate ad proelium incipiendum&quot; (throw the dice to start the fight) are the best results. I hope that helped a bit :)&#39;,

    &#39;body&#39;: &#39;I\&#39;ve been considering doing translations into Latin you know, my friend and classmate is very good at Latin and she\&#39;s mentioned that she used to do translations into Latin for people for fun or something along those lines. I\&#39;ve always thought the best way I learn languages is by reading and absorbing, seeing words multiple times across texts, using them and learning it that way - the thing about Latin is they\&#39;ve always just said &quot;here\&#39;s a list of words - learn em&quot;\n\nI think reading might be helpful too. My school hasn\&#39;t pushed that at all, the problem with the Latin exams is that they\&#39;re pretty ridiculous like a lot of the courses we have to do. They don\&#39;t teach you the useful stuff and they just push the memorization on you rather than absorbing and enjoying which gets lost along the way.\n\nI think I\&#39;m gonna try some of these methods over the next few weeks and see how it goes, thank you for your help!&#39;,

    &#39;body&#39;: &quot;Yes, this is exactly what I thought. I would absolutely recommend the LLPSI books then; you will be able to go quite quickly at least through the beginning, and by the end of the first book you should have internalized most of the grammar. For the later chapters, you will also benefit from rereading them. I would also suggest that you try to avoid thinking in terms of translation, and try reading and understanding the text as Latin, without translating it into English! The LLPSI books will greatly help with this. There is audio for the book on the channel ScorpioMartianus. You may also want to watch his pronunciation videos, because most people have poor pronunciation, especially with regards to nasalization, vowel length, and elision, which, if properly understood and internalized, will aid greatly your understanding of the Language, particularly with poetry. \n\nAnd you might be surprised to know that people *do* write in Latin every day! There is a discord for this sub (see the sidebar) where people use Latin, there are also weekly Latin chats via Zoom, and a host of Latin podcasts of varying difficulty. The podcasts are particularly helpful, in my view, because they help you internalize the grammar but are at the level of simple, day-to-day conversation rather than high literary Latin--because, remember, Latin literature would&#39;ve been difficult for native Latin speakers in the same way English literature is difficult for native English speakers! Writing in Latin is also an excellent way to internalize structures; you can write a short response to whatever you read in Latin that day, and if you get stuck, you can look up how a word is declined/conjugated on Wiktionary, or you can use the sentences from what you read as a scaffold.\n\nThe problem about not knowing how to word things is really unfortunate because that&#39;s not really your fault--translation is a difficult skill and many people know a language quite well but struggle to translate. Many Latin instructors just put a premium on translation, but really it&#39;s an art, not a science. Obviously, you need to understand the Latin, and be able to render it in English. The first part should become easier with the advice I listed above. If you feel your skills still aren&#39;t up to par after you&#39;ve spent a lot of time with level-appropriate input, you might consider reading more English poetry--because at its heart, translation is a creative task, and having a more technical understanding of English creative writing will give you greater command to make your own translations.&quot;,

    &#39;body&#39;: &#39;That sounds quite accurate actually. I feel like I haven\&#39;t had as much to translate with Latin because unlike Russian people don\&#39;t write in it all over the internet everyday, we just went from fairly doable to &quot;what the heck does this mean&quot; very quickly. I\&#39;ll definitely check out that book.\n\nYou can\&#39;t post pictures with text on Reddit for whatever reason so I\&#39;ll link a picture of a text we recently translated [here](https://twitter.com/minjzls/status/1215743934623899648?s=19)\n\nI\&#39;m in my first year of A-Levels in the UK \n\nI find it kind of difficult to recognise constructions like perfect passive participles and ablative absolutes, I know how they work but when I\&#39;m in the midst of a translation I don\&#39;t notice them. Subjunctives are a pain too\n\nAt the minute with our teacher we\&#39;re doing translations at a similar difficulty to the one I linked. We also do Ovid translations with our other teacher but I think everyone finds those difficult, they\&#39;re not horrendous but whenever I translate them I feel like it makes no sense when in actuality I wasn\&#39;t too far off I just didn\&#39;t know how to word it right&#39;,

    &#39;body&#39;: &#39;Your situation is quite common; I don\&#39;t know what particular teaching methods your instructor is using, but typically by your point students begin reading &quot;real&quot; Latin literature even though they\&#39;ve had very little preparation for it, because their instruction so far has mostly focused on grammar and translation. My guess (though I don\&#39;t know your circumstance) is your class has the same problem. The research suggests that when we are learning a second language, we need vast quantity of level appropriate input material (which can include reading, listening, etc); but the standard methods give students a small quantity of *too difficult* material. This is probably a big reason why you find Russian easier, because you\&#39;ve gotten more input material. The single best thing you can do is find intermediate material and read that as extensively as you can; it will help you internalize the language. The best resource if you have not used it is the book series Lingua Latina Per Se Illustrata; the first part of the book may be too easy, but the second half will be your speed and besides, reading the whole thing will help you process Latin as Latin. This post also has some very good intermediate resources: https://www.reddit.com/r/latin/comments/emkbfb/what_to_read_after_llpsi_familia_romana/fdpurl5/. \n\nWhen you are struggling, it is always a good idea to go directly to your instructor and talk about your concerns. That way they know, and they can also suggest a way forward.\n\nIf you tell a little more about your circumstance--what you are working on in class, what\xa0in particular poses problems, what your instructor is doing--we can give you more specific advice as well.&#39;,

And I will in turn elaborate by adding that it\&#39;s doubtful whether -āstī is &quot;for&quot; -āvistī: the former is the standard CL form; the latter one only found with elevated vocabulary, entirely unattested for such everyday terms as [amāre](https://latin.packhum.org/concordance?q=amavis) or [cantāre](https://latin.packhum.org/concordance?q=cantavis). It\&#39;s difficult to ascribe to conincide the fact that Sanskrit has a precisely parallel distribution to Latin in that it has an /u/ ending only in the 1st and 3d p.sg. laryngeal-final perfects: *tastháu, jajñáu, dadáu*. *-ái* on the other hand is clearly analogical to the phonetic contraction of *audī́vī &amp;gt; audī́*, precisely paralleled in *audī́t* \\~&amp;gt; *cantā́t* .&#39;,

By &quot;developments of Proto-Romance verb endings,&quot; I was referring specifically to developments of the perfect stem in -v-, such as -āvī &amp;gt; -ai and -āvit &amp;gt; -aut. The loss of intervocalic /w/ as a semivowel seemed to indicate that these forms developed prior to the shift from /w/ to /β/, and such syncopated forms like -āstī for āvistī are indeed, as you mentioned, attested in Classical Latin. I actually had not realized the intervocalic -v- continued to be lost after the transition from /w/ &amp;gt; /β/, as in your example of -ībat ~ -īvat &amp;gt; -ía. Thank you for your input :)&#39;,

    &#39;body&#39;: &#39;&amp;gt;(most notably Spanish, which still pronounces &quot;v&quot; as /β/ today)\n\nSmall correction: modern Spanish does not have a phoneme /β/. Rather, it has a phoneme /b/ which is pronounced [β] intervocalically, including at the beginning of a word, as well as after continuants like /l/ or /r/. So, &quot;venir&quot; is pronounced [be\&#39;nir] in isolation, but if you say a phrase like &quot;quiero venir&quot; it becomes [\&#39;kjeɾo \&#39;βenir].\n\nIn old Spanish there was probably still a phonemic distinction between &amp;lt;v&amp;gt; [β] and &amp;lt;b&amp;gt; [b] at the beginning of words, but intervocalicaly they merged around the 1st century CE. So, &quot;vivir&quot; would have been [βi\&#39;βir] in Old Spanish while &quot;beber&quot; would have been [be\&#39;βer], but today they are [bi\&#39;βir] and [be\&#39;βer] respectively.&#39;,

    &#39;body&#39;: &quot;&amp;gt;However, we also know that it happened after the developments of Proto-Romance verb endings, meaning that Vulgar Latin was already diverging heavily from Classical Latin by the time the sound change had become widespread.\n\nCan&#39;t help but barge in here and say that:\n\n1. as far as I can tell, the Proto-Romance verb endings are directly derivable from the CL ones (both accompanied and followed by a certain amount of transfers and remodelling), and moreover show variation in the treatment of precisely this intervocalic V, indicating that there was no single form of the perfect in Vulgar Latin, which is not surprising because Vulgar Latin itself is an umbrella term for all the non-standard variation inside Latin: Old Sardinian apparently still had *-avit*, French and  Romanian continue *cantāt,* other languages *cantāut*. All three are attested already in the Classical period (only the latter one hasn&#39;t made it into the literary language, but is already found at Pompeii). See Weiss 2009 (Outline..) p 528.\n2. the fact that V is lost in almost all verbal endings in almost all of Romance is not evidence to its ordering after the development of said endings because even if there had been a single set of proto-Romance endings (which again there wasn&#39;t), V was already optionally lost intervocalically in pre-Classical Latin (resulting in doublets like *dīvitēs\\~dītēs* as well as the already mentioned *l(a)ātrīna*), and continued to vacillate throught the history of the language. The B\\~V intervocalic merger simply fed more instances of the same process, until the V-less variant was generalised in all the verbal endings, as in the imperfect ē/ībat &amp;gt; ē/īvat &amp;gt; é/íat.\n3. To my knowledge, there&#39;s absolutely no indication to any difference in the pronunciation of /V/ between *sermō vulgāris* and any other *sermō*. There&#39;s only indications to regional variation (c.f. Adams 2007 The Regional Diversification... and Adams 2013 Social Variation...).&quot;,

    &#39;body&#39;: &#39;Obligatory I\&#39;m not a language expert, but I studied latin for a long time. The truth is that Latin does not have a V or J. V is the actual grapheme, but it\&#39;s pronounced as a U. They pronounced both as vowel or consonant depending on the word and its position in that word. We do a similar thing in English with Y.\n\nTo kind of get an idea how they conflated the two sounds in one letter in both cases, consider the Latin word &quot;Huius&quot; Hoo-Wee-Yoose there\&#39;s a &quot;U&quot; sound in the first syllable, but it gives way to a &quot;w&quot; sound into the next vowel. The I in the second syllable has the &quot;ee&quot; sound but gives way to a &quot;yoo&quot; sound in the third syllable. The Romans would have spelled this &quot;HVIVS&quot; but they would have the respective sounds above. \n\nIus would have been Yoose however. As language evolves, the speakers often contract or imprecisely pronounce words. How many times have you said &quot;ay&quot; and not &quot;uh&quot; for the word &quot;a&quot; in the above paragraphs even though that\&#39;s &quot;proper&quot;? In the first sentence your reading voice probably read the first sentence as &quot;...uh vee or jay&quot; but the fourth sentence &quot;wee doo ay similerr thing...&quot; (I\&#39;m intentionally spelling to pronunciation in these examples). You also probably didn\&#39;t say &quot;sim-ih-laar&quot;, you said &quot;SIM-ih-ler&quot;. You do this and they likely did the same with ius (ee-yoose) as yoose as they spoke conversantly with other Latins. By contracting the sound like this, they developped these letters with a consonantal and verbal form.&#39;,

    &#39;body&#39;: &#39;[Follow-up]\n\nThere are multiple reasons that we know &quot;v&quot; was pronounced as /w/. Contractions are one of the biggest - we see the intervocalic (between vowels) &quot;v&quot; being elided and skipped over entirely. A *lātrīna*, or bath (whence English &quot;latrine&quot;), is really a *lavātrīna*, from the verb *lavāre* (to wash), i.e. a &quot;place for washing.&quot; We see the same kind of contraction with *mōmentum* from *movimentum* and many, many others. We also see contractions where &quot;v&quot; becomes &quot;u&quot;, as in *faustus*, which is contracted from *favestus*. We also occasionally see remnants of this in modern Romance words. For example, *cīvitātem* yields French *cité* and Italian *città*, both of which feature the same elision of the original v, which is absent in the modern words. However, in Spanish, it is the second &quot;i&quot; of *cīvitātem* that is lost. The modern Spanish word is *ciudad*. \n\nPronouncing &quot;v&quot; as /v/ really breaks all observable patterns, since determining when to pronounce it as /v/ versus /u/ or /w/ is entirely arbitrary. The verbs *statuere* and *volvere* have past participles *statūtus* and *volūtus* respectively, but, in the ecclesiastical pronunciation, *stat**u**ere* has /u/, and *vol**v**ere* has /v/. It breaks an obvious pattern for no reason other than alignment with modern pronunciation. Another example is the verb *caveō,* with past participle *cautus,* which, if &quot;v&quot; is presumed to be pronounced /v/, has /v/ in the infinitive, but /u/ in the participle. The reverse is true of *gaudeō,* with past participle *gāvīsus*. \n\nIt also makes far more sense for &quot;v&quot; to be pronounced /w/ when considering cognates. &quot;Vir&quot; (man) is derived as being a cognate to English &quot;were-&quot; as in &quot;werewolf&quot; (man-wolf). English and other Germanic languages additionally borrowed many words from Latin many centuries ago. &quot;Wall&quot; and &quot;wine&quot; come from &quot;vallum&quot; and &quot;vīnum,&quot; respectively. We can also see evidence in cognates from languages from Latin\&#39;s time. The Ancient Greek word for wine was *οἶνος* (oînos), which sounds far closer to *vīnum* when pronounced with /w/. We also see Ancient Greek *ναῦς* (nâus) cognate to Latin *nāvis*, among others.&#39;,

    &#39;body&#39;: &#39;In Classical Latin, V was pronounced /w/. This is undisputed by linguists. However, we do know that in the *sermo vulgaris*, the common speech, V began to transition into the sound /β/. If you\&#39;re unfamiliar with the IPA, this sound is like a &quot;v&quot; in English, except, instead of using your top teeth and bottom lip, you use both lips as if to make a &quot;b&quot; sound, but push air between them as you would for a &quot;v&quot; sound. Since then, the vast majority or Romance languages have since progressed to from /β/ to our modern /v/, with some exceptions (most notably Spanish, which still pronounces &quot;v&quot; as /β/ today) \n\nThis sound change really isn\&#39;t that unexpected - for one, we observe the same change in other languages, such as Ancient Greek. For example, in modern Greek, the word τραύμα (trauma) is still written with the vowel letter &quot;υ&quot; but will be pronounced by any modern speaker as &quot;travma.&quot; /w/ and /β/ are closely related sounds - the only real difference between them is that, from /w/ to /β/, the lips go from being almost, but not fully, closed to having full closure. \n\nWe think that this shift began around a century before the first century CE. We know this because of attested typos in which letters and such mistakenly write &quot;b&quot; where &quot;v&quot; would be correct. However, we also know that it happened after the developments of Proto-Romance verb endings, meaning that Vulgar Latin was already diverging heavily from Classical Latin by the time the sound change had become widespread.&#39;,

However, there isn&#39;t necessarily a consensus on what norms should govern how people should speak it today. The w pronunciation is the older one, and plenty of people who only read Classical Latin will only use that one. But people whose experience with Latin is informed by its historical use within the Catholic church will often prefer that pronunciation. Some people may switch between different pronunciation styles depending on the text that they are reading, but that in itself can be annoying and it&#39;s much easier for people to just pick a style they&#39;re comfortable with and stick with it.&quot;,

    &#39;body&#39;: &#39;I think the reason we can be reasonably sure that V was *originally* (like in the long long ago, when the Roman alphabet was new) pronounced W is that V and U were the same letter at first--distinguishing them is only a few hundred years old. The question then becomes: if V and U were such widely different sounds from the very beginning, why would they have been written with the same letter? The only reasonable answer is that that letter used to represent both the consonantal and vocalic versions of the same sound, and diverged only later (but still much earlier than the forms of the letter were distinguished).&#39;,

    &#39;body&#39;: &#39;To clarify -- the confusion comes from the fact that to figure out gender and number, you\&#39;re more interested in the antecedent, but (and this is the key) the case of the pronoun does *not* come from the antecedent. Look at what the pronoun itself is doing *in the relative clause*. Cf. English -- The students whom the teacher loves are the best. Even though &quot;students&quot; is the subject, the pronoun is still in the objective case because the pronoun is the direct object of the clause &quot;whom the teacher loves.&quot; In the clause, the teacher loves the students -- students is the object of the clause. Thus, the pronoun (which stands in for the students in the clause) is the direct object of &quot;loves.&quot; In a Latin sentence, you would therefore use the accusative case.&#39;,

    &#39;body&#39;: &quot;Mostly you need volume, it doesn&#39;t particularly matter what you read as long as you&#39;re able to read it. Here are some options in no particular order.\n\n* Ritchie&#39;s Fabulae Faciles: https://geoffreysteadman.com/ritchies-fabulae-faciles/\n* Re-read Familia Romana (or just your favourite chapters, I like Cap. X. for example)\n* Read the storylines from mainstream textbooks (Reading Latin, Cambridge Latin Course, Oxford Latin Course, the stories that go with Wheelocks, etc.) I personally really like the story in Oxford and the Cambridge ones are free online at the moment.\n* Read the easier stories in Fabulae Syrae and Fabulae Latinae (in the LLPSI series)\n* Read some novellas such as Pugio Bruti (Here is a list: https://drive.google.com/open?id=1bF8hZuxTDtgNMSSdonEX112JJaVYqoPH7w27Oju9ETs) If you&#39;ve read Familia Romana then I&#39;d focus on the ones that have 100+ unique words; you&#39;ll read them easily and learn a bunch of new words. *Cloelia* has a free PDF.\n* Take a look at some of the material in Sermones Romani if it interests you.\n* These are some Vergil/Caesar tiered readers: https://lapis.practomime.com/index.php/operation-caesar-reading-list There are other similar things you can buy as books (I like this one: https://comprehensibleclassics.wordpress.com/publications/). This Horace one is free: https://twitter.com/magisterb480/status/1211663363551506432\n* Check out podcasts and Latin videos on Youtube. I recommend especially looking at Latinitium&#39;s videos https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCxS3m8PITAWuADD9Nic1YOg (some are easier than others, poke around what interests you and don&#39;t worry about getting 100% comprehension)\n* This is my favourite ScorpioMartianus video and I think it&#39;s pretty comprehensible: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bv-nqVBewI\n* Harry Potter and other translations are good if you know the original really well. If you don&#39;t then it&#39;ll probably be horrifying. The Latin isn&#39;t perfect, but it won&#39;t hurt you as long as it&#39;s not the only thing you ever read.\n* The Vulgate is relatively easy if you already know the material pretty well.\n* I don&#39;t know that *Ad Alpes* is necessarily easier than Roma Aeterna, but I like it. Maybe have a read if you get stuck in/tired of Roma Aeterna.\n* This page has a lot of stuff on it, have a poke around: http://hiberna-cr.wikidot.com/reading-material\n* Check out these dialogues which ScorpioMartianus has recorded: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kaQt4Ormzbs&amp;amp;list=PLU1WuLg45Sixy5Me3wULYlzWiDFuHDIYv (I believe there are more things along similar lines on his Patreon which you might be interested in)\n* Here are a bunch of 2 line poems with (relatively) constricted vocabulary (They can still be challenging): http://distichalatina.blogspot.com/\n* Another list (note especially the myth/history readers pulled together from textbooks): http://johnpiazza.net/latin/online-reading/\n* Legonium has (among other things) an ongoing series which is illustrated with Lego. You can get it as a lovely book version if you want: http://www.legonium.com/\n* These are only &#39;easy&#39; compared to really quite difficult classical literature, but maybe you&#39;ll want to take a look after Roma Aeterna, or if you&#39;re super interested in one of them: https://medium.com/in-medias-res/beach-reading-ten-easy-latin-works-e3bbe7bf6648&quot;,

    &#39;body&#39;: &#39;This is from Browne Hospital in Stamford. It was founded by a rich wool merchant, William Browne, in 1485. Between 12 and 14 local poor people have lived there ever since. Historically it owned a lot of farmland and other property, and in 1870 some of this was taken over by the government, sold and used to found a new school for girls.&#39;,

    &#39;body&#39;: &#39;Here\&#39;s an exercise: Read a sentence. Then recite it from memory. Do it for the next one in the paragraph, etc. Maybe you have to check it a few times or cut it into 2-3 chunks and repeat them each 5 times before you can piece the whole thing together. Just doing this a few minutes each day will make the rest of your reading much more &quot;active&quot; and &quot;mindful&quot;. It gets rid of the autopilot /u/Unbrutal_Russian mentioned.\n\n8 readings isn\&#39;t a lot. We need something like 20+ repetitions of a word to chisel it into our memory. How to actually do that in spite of boredom is the real challenge. Perhaps don\&#39;t pronounce everything out loud and read through it silently, faster? Consider whether you would have phrased everything the same way. Maybe try to say what the text does with your own words.&#39;,

Third blank, I have no idea if they want a verb like splenduit or exornavit, a participle like exornato another noun like gemmīsque or something. Fourth blank I\&#39;m pretty sure is marmore.\n\nMy trouble is I have too many options to choose from.

    &#39;body&#39;: &quot;I had the same problem unless I did them immediately after reading the whole chapter in one sitting (which can get tough already in FR, not to mention RA). Luckily there are the CDs with automated pensa, which first give you a hint to the reading and line the sentence is found at, and if you still can&#39;t find it, the whole answer. Even when I was getting stuck at every second sentence, the very act of looking for the answers in the text still made me learn something, and the next time I was doing the same Pensum, there was a good chance that I remembered the precise answer.\n\nThe fact that you can think of several possibilities can be a good or a bad thing - the former if they&#39;re all possible in the given context, which means you have bigger than expected vocabulary; the latter if some aren&#39;t, which means you need to clarify the difference between them.\n\nI don&#39;t think it&#39;s reasonable to expect the learner to learn all the new vocabulary in the chapter just from a few readings; especially when much of it only occurs once or twice. But as your example shows, even many repeated readings won&#39;t fix this because after a while you&#39;re no longer learning, just wading through the same old bog on autopilot. You need to be in the new territory, learning, pattern-recognition, contextually-inferring frame of mind in order to learn new vocabulary.\n\nUltimately, use the CD (which is piratable and mountable) or write each word from the new vocab list down yourself together with a Latin rephrasing (the ones in the margins with some personal elaborations) and the context it occurs in in the book.&quot;,

If you cannot write the words in the blanks, you haven&#39;t acquired the words (you may have acquired passive recognition of them to some extent).  So, listen to the chapter again, answer the questions about the chapter, write your own short summaries, talk to someone about the chapter in Latin, etc.  It boils down to whether you been exposed to those words (in a meaningful context, ie not just a list)a sufficient number of times to acquire them/their meaning.

You may not know grammar in the abstracted way, such as what a gerund is and how it&#39;s different from a participle, but you still know English.  If anything, Latin will teach you these abstractions in English.&quot;,

So, &#39;domi&#39; - at my house/at home, &#39;domi meae&#39; - in MY house.\nSo, if the subject of the sentence owns a house, you would use locative (Domi sum. - I&#39;m at my house. Amicus domi est. - My friend is at his house.) For other poples&#39; place, you would use the preposition in + ablative: &#39;in domo eius sum&#39; (I&#39;m at his place), &#39;Petrus in domo amicae meae est&#39; (Peter is at my friend&#39;s house) etc.&quot;,

    &#39;body&#39;: &#39;I know that, but [this video](https://youtu.be/VwLS-fh3pVg) mentions that you don’t use prepositions with nouns that can be in the locative.\n\nFor example: “Rōmam domō venīs” would be “you come to Rome from the house.”    \nAre prepositions other than “ab” and “ad” still used with nouns that have a locative?\n\nEdit: my comment is wrong. You don’t need prepositions for movement towards or from. I didn’t pay enough attention to the video I linked.&#39;,

    &#39;body&#39;: &#39;The case endings on the locative for 1st/2nd declension adjectives match, so &quot;-i/-ae/-i&quot; and &quot;-is/-is/-is&quot; plural for meus-a-um. It would be \&#39;-i\&#39; and \&#39;-ibus\&#39; for a 3rd declension adjective.\n\nThe difference between locative and ablative of place where is just convention. Both mean roughly the same thing. It is better practice to use locative for answering the question of &quot;is he home or away&quot; with &quot;at home, domi&quot; but when the scene is near the house itself, with &quot;in the house/within the walls/under the roof&quot; with in/sub + ablative of such words as &quot;domus, murus, tectum&quot; as needed. You can see this play out in both Plautus and Terence. \n\nHowever, to be more confusing: using &quot;in&quot; + ablative with a locative word (cities/towns/small islands) gives the idea of being &quot;in the area/territory/vicinity&quot; of the noun.&#39;,

    &#39;body&#39;: &#39;I’m aware that the cases still would be locative, but I think I worded it badly. I was really wondering if the “meae” was the same as the genitive “meae” or if there is a locative case for adjectives (or in this case the possessive pronoun).\n\nThis would be an important distinction if I wanted to say “In my Athens”, as Athēnīs is the same as plural ablative/dative, right? Would that be “Athēnīs meīs”?    \nI know you’re not supposed to use adjectives with proper names, but I guess it’s still worth knowing.\n\nI don’t think I properly understand the difference between “in domō”/“domī”. Is “in domō” strictly for being *inside* the house, while “domī” is being just *nearby*? Can you use domī for being inside, too?&#39;,

There’s a third use for genitive, too (the partitive) but I don’t think that has any application to mors. Please, if I’m wrong, somebody correct me! \n\nOn occasion, you’ll see mortis used as the plural accusative form of mors- so, as an object, e.g., “I’ve seen many deaths.” I’m not sure when that’s used, though, because in that form you’d typically see mortes.&#39;,

    &#39;body&#39;: &#39;*Memento mori* is the classic saying, and so I\&#39;ll copy-paste something I wrote on this phrase earlier:\n\nQuite literally, *Memento mori*  means &quot;remember to die&quot;. But it sounds rather silly in English, as if  you forget it you\&#39;ll live forever. There are a few interpretations here:  *mori* is infinitive, but it can  be also be treated as a gerund when it\&#39;s a direct object, so then it  would be: &quot;Remember dying&quot; or &quot;keep in mind (the act of) dying&quot;. It is also possible that it was an accusative + infinitive construction originally, *te mori*, but then *te* was dropped. *Memento te mori* \\- &quot;Remember you die&quot; or &quot;Remember that you die&quot;.\n\nSo *memento mori* focuses on mortality, especially your own mortality - remember that you are going to die one day. *Memento mortem* is quite literally &quot;remember death&quot;, as in &quot;remember that death exists&quot; or &quot;keep death in mind&quot;.&#39;,

    &#39;body&#39;: &#39;Macrons &quot;work&quot; in the Reconstructed pronunciation just fine---which is why I use them there.  The Traditional English Pronunciation of Latin, however, is such that you *cannot* observe both it and the rules of quantity at the same time; they are *mutually exclusive*.  I could use a &quot;long a&quot; (in reality, the diphthong /ei/) to &quot;simulate&quot; the macron, and the &quot;short a&quot; (the non-diphthongised version) for all other cases; but that would just sound ridiculous.\n\nThis goes to such a point that when doing poetry (I\&#39;ve grown quite fond of Horace), I\&#39;ve had to *unlearn* a few things.  The usual stuff---not pronouncing the *j* as in *justice*, or the Latin word *nunc* to rhyme with the English word *trunk*\\---that\&#39;s just the tip of the iceberg, really.&#39;,

It’s just that I teach myself, so sometimes I miss things. I definitely know the word, it’s just that sometimes I’ll get stuck thinking of a word or a construction a certain way, and I can’t think of my other options. In cases like that, I find it helps to get a fresh eye. The rest of this page was perfectly decipherable to me, I just got mixed up in an old way of thinking when I was going through that little exchange.&#39;,

    &#39;body&#39;: &quot;I did that for a few months recently, just to check it out.\n\nYou do find the odd error in the Latin, though not too many, and I found that sometimes the app would offer me four incorrect multiple choice options, which seemed both unfair and confusing (this happens in the French and Italian courses too). You also run into patches where it seems like every sentence is missing the exact same word or even form of a word, like several in a row needing you to supply *mensam* after *supra* or *mensa* after *sub* or an *e* or *ex* in a sentence with *oriundus*, and this can be a little tedious when it&#39;s something you know well already.\n\nA lot of the sentences are contemporary and conversational, and there is some Christian Latin mixed in there, so it is one of a small minority of Latin courses that treats the language as something other than strictly ancient.\n\nWe are probably being a little generous in calling this a &#39;course&#39;, since it will not teach you much by itself, but I think it is a nice thing to do in addition to other Latin study.\n\nCertain things just &#39;click&#39; with some people, so it&#39;s worth trying just to see if it happens to work for you and get you doing that little bit of extra study every day. I would say the same for Duolingo, or for a flashcard application or site like Anki or Quizlet. What initially got *me* studying every day was making my own flashcards in Mnemosyne (similar to Anki or SuperMemo), but no one I have recommended that to has ended up sticking with it. Just find what works for you.&quot;,

    &#39;body&#39;: &#39;It’s more common in Greek because many of these prefixes in Greek were originally adverbs, entirely separate words.  Early poetry such as Homer preserves situations where these words still function independently.  Later Greeks thought they had been split off from the main word, so they talked of &quot;cutting&quot;, or tmesis.  It gave them permission to split other things that originally were never split.  I think the same word appears as -tomy in modern medical terms, such as appendectomy, or lumpectomy.&#39;,

Consciously, intentionally and deliberately to avoid the employment of split infinitives in English is a marker of good breeding, and credible education. Split infinitives are inherently ugly in English. If one hears English prose which includes split infinitives, one is inclined automatically and without further hesitation to dismiss the author wholly from serious consideration.

    &#39;body&#39;: &#39;Word order in Latin isn\&#39;t very important at all. In English, word order is everything. &quot;The dog bites the man,&quot; and &quot;The man bites the dog,&quot; are two entirely different sentences because the order of the words is different.  But in Latin it can be either &quot;Canis virum mordet,&quot; or &quot;Canis mordet virum,&quot; or &quot;Mordet canis virum,&quot; ect. and the sentences mean the same thing. \n\nIn any textbook Latin word order will usually keep to subject then object then verb. But in reality it can be in any order and still make sense. To put it simply, this is because Latin is an inflection language and therefore we can understand what a word is doing in a sentence by its ending and see if it is the subject or object of a sentence and the verb ending will also confirm and tells us what the subject is. So there isn\&#39;t a preferable version and you can choose which ever. Often in Latin poetry, word order is messed with to emphasis one word over the other by having it go before.&#39;,

    &#39;body&#39;: &#39;I would say either &quot;Lingua lāmentātiō cordis est.&quot; or &quot;Lingua lāmentātiō pectoris est.&quot; With cordis meaning the heart and pectoris meaning the general chest area. But sometimes in Latin poetry pectus is used as meaning the seat of emotion in a person.\n\nThe online translations you offered seem to be very mistaken. &quot;Lingua cordis flebitis,&quot; seems to mean &quot;Language of the heart, you all will weep.&quot; With, for some reason, flebitis in a second person, plural, future conjugation.\n\n&quot;Lingua est cor lāmentātiōne.&quot; meaning something like &quot;Language is the heart (by or using or with) lamentation.&quot; Lāmentātiō, here, is in the ablative form for some reason and cordis, here, is in its nominative or accusative form.\n\n&quot;Lingua cordis est et plangent.&quot; is something like &quot;Language is of the heart and they will bewail.&quot; Plangent in the third person, plural, future conjugation.\n\n&quot;Lingua est plangite cordis.&quot; is hard to tell what it\&#39;s suppose to mean. It could be &quot;Language is of the heart, bewail you!&quot; With plangite being in the 2nd person, singular, imperative conjugation as if someone is giving an order to bewail.\n\nIn essence, I think the translations are trying to warn you of something and you should be careful&#39;,

I don\&#39;t know how I never stumbled upon this word in the first place, but I think *intellēctus, intellēctūs* would capture your meaning. &quot;Comprehension; understanding; discerning.&quot;\n\nThus you could say *Enchīridion Intellēctuī*, &quot;guide to/for the purpose of understanding&quot;, or *Enchīridion dē Intellēctū*, &quot;Guide concerning/of understanding&quot;.&#39;,

    &#39;body&#39;: &#39;English has rules about order of adjectives, use of the words “do/does/did” (very confusing for non-native Speakers), rules about forming comparatives that are more complex than in Romance languages, etc etc. Tenses can be quite complex in English - superficially, there is less inflection. But, does the simple present actually mean you’re doing something at the time of speaking? If I say, “I eat meat,” no one imagines I am actually eating at the time. All that means is, “I am not a vegetarian. “ If I say “I’m eating meat now,” that should be a clear statement that I am eating meat at the moment, right? But, that could also mean, “I used to be a vegetarian, but nowadays I am back to eating meat.”\n\nEnglish has very formal “rules” about object pronouns (whom), not ending a sentence with a preposition, not splitting infinitives, etc, and these are best ignored almost all the time, except in those very situations in which you should not ignore them.\n\nIn English (and other languages) there’s a huge difference between, “He has few flaws,” and “he has a few flaws.” \n\nIn English, stress changes in an interesting way when a new compound concept starts to be considered a familiar single concept. People used to say “hotDOG” but now we say “HOTdog,” to give one example. \n\nAny linguist who knows anything about English knows that it has an interesting grammar just like any other language. \n\nAlso, your own post has a mistake. You should have said, “English grammar is,” not “English grammar it’s.” Also you should compare English grammar to Italian grammar, not English grammar to Italian. Your second sentence is not strictly incorrect, but does not sound like a native speaker wrote it, even if you replaced “English” with something like “chess.”&#39;,

Google doesn&#39;t have a real TTS for Latin, and among their TTS for other languages, I personally found Polish&amp;gt;German=Dutch&amp;gt;Spanish&amp;gt;Portuguese&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;Italian when I put in some Latin text. I don&#39;t know why they used their Italian TTS for Latin rather than the Polish one. \n\nFor TTS dedicated Latin, have a look at these links:\n\n [https://loquarblog.wordpress.com/2017/09/29/classical-latin-tts-an-inelegant-solution-to-the-dearth-of-quality-latin-audio/](https://loquarblog.wordpress.com/2017/09/29/classical-latin-tts-an-inelegant-solution-to-the-dearth-of-quality-latin-audio/)\n\n [http://nesrad.blogspot.com/2017/09/classical-latin-text-to-speech-tts.html](http://nesrad.blogspot.com/2017/09/classical-latin-text-to-speech-tts.html)&quot;,

    &#39;body&#39;: &#39;This question really illustrates the absolute and utter futility of these types of exercises.

In Latin, being covered with sweat would, I believe, be something like &quot;totum corpus sudor habet&quot; or &quot;toto corpore sudor manat.&quot;   Maybe &quot;sudore madidus.&quot;  Either way, these types of exercises are the antithesis of what you want to do to get idiomatic command of another language, especially if your teacher isn\&#39;t explaining what I just did.&#39;,

    &#39;body&#39;: &#39;No, both examples are nominative **gerundives**, in which *delendi* describes *fasciculi,* hence they agree in form, and your English translation of the second one *(files to delete)* is actually *(files to be deleted),* and it refers to the files themselves. The corresponding **gerund** is *fasciculos delendum* (deleting (deletion) of the files), which refers to the action *delere* rather than the files, and *fasciculos* is the object of the action. These are different constructions. When the **gerund** would have an object in the accusative, the corresponding **gerundive** is usually used instead. This means *fasciculi delendi* is preferred over *fasciculos delendum,* though they can be used for the same purpose. For example, both *consilium fasciculorum delendorum* (genitive of gerundive) and *consilium fasciculos delendi* (genitive of gerund) mean the same thing (the plan to delete files), but the first one is preferred.&#39;,

    &#39;body&#39;: &#39;These two examples of &quot;-endi nouns&quot; are genitive gerunds. However, it is not the case that all such expressions are gerunds. They can be genitive gerunds, or nominative plural masculine gerundives, or genitive singular masculine/neuter gerundives.\n\nGerunds have the forms of singular neuter nouns in the second declension, and they are used in accusative, genitive, ablative and dative (not in nominative case). Gerunds refer to the verbs themselves as actions in active sense (not describing any nouns), like &quot;eating&quot;, &quot;living&quot; in English.\n\nGerundives are passive future participles, in the forms of adjectives in the first and second declensions. For example, in *Amici vocandi sunt (Friends must (should) be called), &quot;*vocandi&quot; is a nominative plural masculine gerundive, which describes &quot;amici&quot; (pl. nom.) In &quot;*Nomen amici vocandi Marcus est.&quot;(The name of the friend who must(should) be called is Marcus), &quot;*vocandi&quot; is a genitive singular masculine gerundive, which describes &quot;amici&quot; (sg. gen.)\n\nThe different cases of gerunds and gerundives have different meanings.&#39;,

I would not learn them all at once and steadily add a new declension when you feel you are ready. Writing them helps but so does associating mememories or imagery with them. It just takes time and practice. Also don&#39;t forget irregulars like dea. These should be learned after you have the declension down pat so you don&#39;t mix them up.&quot;,

    &#39;body&#39;: &#39;There are quite a few patterns in the endings, which makes it a lot easier if you recognize them.\n\nFor example: the plural dative, accusative, and ablative have a 1-2-1 pattern in every declension: īs-ās-īs, īs-ōs-īs, ibus-ēs-ibus, ibus-ūs-ibus, ēbus-ēs-ēbus.\n\nThe accusative singular is always two letters ending in M. -am, -um, -em, -um, -em.\n\nThe genitive plural is always an -um: -ōrum, -ārum, -um (or ium), -uum, ērum.\n\nThe ablative singular is always one letter, usually long: -ā, -ō, e, ū, ē.&#39;,

This is by far the easiest way and the most efficient in the long term.\n\nIf you really want to brute force the issue, then make flashcards with example sentences that each use different endings but are otherwise similar. This should focus your attention on the endings when you study the sentences.\n\nLearning the endings in isolation isn&#39;t going to help very much, because you need to associate them directly with what they mean in a sentence.&quot;,

    &#39;body&#39;: &quot;1. Divide a sentence into sense units of two-three words not counting monosyllables and other clitics. The borders between these units, where you make a break in pronunciation, will be your elision boundary.\n2. Inside the units, final short vowels elide completely; everything else might or might not leave a non-syllabic trace depending on how different the two vowels are (in a sequence of identical vowels, the first one was likely elided entirely regardless of length, but nasalisation might have optionally remained, if *identidem* is from *idem et idem*). Long and nasalised I and V typically survive as /j/ and /w/, especially before short vowels. Short I and V in the following syllable might be barely detectable, especially in the prefix IN-, especially when the previous clashing vowel is Ā (the most sonorous vowel).\n3. Between the units, how long the pause is decides the details.\n4. /ũst/ was probably pronounced with little to no nasalisation, because the only way it&#39;s ever spelt is VST (c.f. mostly *mṓ****n****strum* but exclusively *mōstéllum).* Length in that position is also highly unlikely, seeing as it gives a final unstressed syllable of 4 measures of length (moras).&quot;,

As /u/zluizl points out, the best bet is a non syllabic nasal vowel, so [ũ̯] or [w̃] depending on how you wanna transcribe it. There are exceptions, like when authors literally write -st instead of &quot;est&quot;, but it is erroneous to assume that this was the rule. We should observe how elision occurs in modern languages like Italian.&#39;,

Not only does the vocabulary encompass archaic, Classical, Medieval, Renaissance, Neo-Latin and quite a few of Berard&#39;s own neologisms, the subject matter also encompasses Eastern religious doctrine (especially on the subject of re-incarnation and Nirvana), quantum physics, and information technology. I get exhausted trying to read about physics or IT in my native English, so I can&#39;t claim to have kept up with everything Berard was saying. Far from it. I also can&#39;t claim to have any idea whether Berard has any expertise in Eastern religion, or physics, or IT. I can say that I found the parts I understood to be dazzlingly good. (I can also definitely say: Cicero, this ain&#39;t!)\n\nI&#39;m going to have to rest for a year or two, and then re-read both novels.

My mind is reeling. This is absolutely first-class literature. Would Pynchon approve? Yes, if Pynchon can read Latin.\n\nPraecursus -- so far, 100 pages in out of 445 -- could be described as a sort of an anti-Matrix: humans are being closely observed by immensely powerful machines, but the machines are benevolent. And also, they do not seem to have been made by humans.\n\nOn the topic of &quot;difficult&quot; reading: there is writing which is complex for no particular reason; there is that which is complex because the author is inept and does not know how to write plainly; there is pretentious writing -- and then there is that which is beautifully complex, and which rewards great effort on the reader\&#39;s part. I put the word &quot;difficult&quot; in quotes because I am convinced that the difficulty of a given text is relative. The more enjoyment a reader derives from a text, the less difficult the text will seem, even if it requires great exertion in order to be understood. And there\&#39;s no way to be certain that, just because A enjoys something, B will also enjoy it. And if they disagree, it doesn\&#39;t mean that A is right and B is wrong or vice-versa. Art is irreducably subjective -- or I am greatly mistaken. To compare the &quot;difficulty&quot; of a text to physical exertion: for one and the same person, walking for 100 yards may seem very difficult, or running for several hours may be pleasant, depending on a variety of physical, psychological, environmental and other factors.&#39;,

    &#39;body&#39;: &#39;Russo Antonio above is right that this page contains two religious readings.  The second, which starts at the fancy capital “E”, is from the Book of Lamentations, chapter 3, verse 1: “Ego vir videns paupertatem meam in virga indignationis eius” (“I am a man who sees my poverty by the rod of his indignation”).  It is the third reading from a church service called matins (or morning prayer) held on Good Friday, part of the original tenebrae service.  \n\nYou can read more about this and the structure of the service here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tenebrae\n\nThe first sentence is a fragment of the second responsory (or chant) which the congregation (probably monks) would sing after the second reading and before the start of the third.  The part we see here is the last five words from the verse of that responsory: “Petrae scissae sunt, et monumenta aperta sunt, et multa corpora sanctorum qui dormierant, surrexerunt.” (“The rocks were split, and the graves were opened; and many bodies of the saints who slept, arose.”).  This refers to the moment of Christ’s death on the cross. The chant from which it comes is known as the velum templi or “veil of the temple” which was torn in two at the same time, according to the gospel accounts.\n\nThe text in the image starts halfway through the fourth word of the Latin: “-rum qui dormierant, surrexerunt”.  \n\nSo, I would hazard a guess the page comes from a late medieval service book, which would originally have been used in worship during Holy Week.\n\nP.S. I see that in the time if took me to type this out on my iPad, a few people got in before me with the answer you need.  Apologies for the duplication!&#39;,

    &#39;body&#39;: &#39;This is a portion of the sung office of matins for Good Friday. The top portion comes from the second responsory for Good Friday. Here\&#39;s the rest of the sentence: \n\n&amp;gt; Petrae scissae sunt, et monumenta aperta sunt,\net multa corpora sanctorum qui dormierant, surrexerunt.\n\nTranslated:\n&amp;gt; The rocks were split, and the graves were opened;\nand many bodies of the saints who slept, arose.\n\nIt\&#39;s slightly adapted from Matthew 27:51-52 &amp;amp; Luke 23:42. [Full text](http://www1.cpdl.org/wiki/index.php/Velum_templi), if you\&#39;re interested.\n\nThe bottom portion beginning with &quot;Aleph&quot; begins one of the readings for Good Friday matins, from the Lamentations of Jeremiah. Any time you see Hebrew letters (aleph, beth, ghimel, etc) in the middle of a passage in Latin, it\&#39;s almost certainly from Lamentations, which has this unique acrostic format. This reading starts at Lamentations 3:\n\n&amp;gt; ALEPH. Ego vir videns paupertatem meam\n        in virga indignationis ejus.\n\nTranslated:\n&amp;gt; ALEPH. I am a man who sees my affliction\nat the rod of his wrath.\n\nSource: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tenebrae&#39;,

In my mouth, *i* used as a vowel makes the sounds you&#39;d expect, but *i* used as a consonant (aka *i longa* or *j*) makes the /dʒ/ sound in *justice*, the so-called voiced post-alveolar affricate.  I find it helpful to use *i* and *j* in their proper places, so that I pronounce them right; don&#39;t want to read *maiorem* and slip up and say *mayorem* instead of *majorem*.\n\nOpening question and exclamation marks, though, I think are best left in Spanish where they belong.  Let&#39;s not bring that into Latin.\n\nThe abbreviations I&#39;m of two minds about.  Putting them into printed matter just looks...

    &#39;body&#39;: &#39;Trying to keep entirely to Classical orthography is just pointless IMO. It’s important to remember that writing *encodes* language but it is not itself the language. The last 2k years have seen significant advances in making Latin easier to read, but these advances haven’t changed the language. The Aeneid is still the Aeneid whether or not I use spaces between the words. I use anything and everything that makes Latin easier to encode because I want to think about the Latin—not the encoding system. So, yeah I’ll use Js and Us and modern punctuation. I’ll write *quum* and use upper/lower case letters. Stylistic things like what your talking about depends on how easy it is for me to type. I’ll write out “a e” mostly because I’m not really setup to type the full Unicode character set. That’s also why I don’t type macrons.&#39;,

    &#39;body&#39;: &#39;I saw that the last six months are obtaneid by putting &quot;-ber&quot; at the end of the cardinal numeral adjective while the first six months are formed by putting &quot;-ilis&quot; at the end of the ordinal numeral adjective so I suggest you to translate &quot;Triamber&quot; with &quot;Tertiilis&quot; like &quot;Quintilis&quot; or &quot;Sextilis&quot; because &quot;tertius&quot; is the ordinal of &quot;tres&quot; which means &quot;three&quot;. &quot;Quintilis&quot; seems to be &quot;quintus&quot; + &quot;ilis&quot; and &quot;Sextilis&quot; looks like &quot;sextus&quot; + &quot;ilis&quot;.&#39;,

    &#39;body&#39;: &#39;Quintilis and Sextilis are possibilities I have considered while studying about this, because they were the names of July and August on the Julian calendar. However, I\&#39;m wanting to know how uniform I can make the calendar while sticking to what we already have. I. e. is &quot;Triamber&quot; a valid name? Most months that end with &quot;ber&quot; are numbers that also end with the letter &quot;m&quot; (septem, novem, decem...) so I don\&#39;t know if the same rule can be applied to &quot;Tri+ber&quot;&#39;,

    &#39;body&#39;: &#39;That\&#39;s because Romulus created a ten years calendar, then the following kings added two months and &quot;Quintilis&quot; and &quot;Sextilis&quot; were renamed &quot;July&quot; and &quot;August&quot; after Julius Caesar and Octavian divinization. So you can write &quot;Quintilis&quot; or &quot;Sextilis&quot; for the 5th and the 6th month because the Romans already used to call them in that way. I\&#39;d translate &quot;Primilis&quot; for the 1st month, &quot;Secundilis&quot; for the 2nd month, &quot;Tertiilis&quot; for the 3rd month, &quot;Quartilis&quot; for the 4th month, &quot;Undecimber&quot; for the 11th month and &quot;Duodecimber&quot; for the 12th month.&#39;,

How the program is structured along with the audio has been really helpful and I&#39;m retaining far more in a few weeks than I did in a few years of college French. I do plan on taking this further when I&#39;ve finished with Duolingo. If it helps, because of Duolingo&#39;s organization and structure, it&#39;s made learning other languages easier as well.&quot;,

    &#39;body&#39;: &quot;I started learning Latin about 3 months ago. I started when I found out that Duolingo had recently made their Latin course public.\n\nI went hard at it for a while, topping the weekly rankings, and watched a few Youtube videos on declensions and verb conjugations, but once I got Lingua Latina Per Se Illustrata, I realised that efficiency wise, spending an hour reading a chapter of LLPSI was far better than an hour on Duolingo.\n\n&amp;amp;#x200B;\n\nI still keep my streak on it, 1. So I can know how many days since I started learning Latin, and 2. because if I have a spare 5 minutes in the day, duolingo is more productive than Facebook. I also suspect that once the verb conjugations were made explicit to me, the constant exposure to them in Duolingo helped cement them in my mind faster than reading may have. But I&#39;ve gone from trying to get 200 points per day down to maybe 2.\n\nThe Duolingo course is also extremely short compared to other Duolingo languages, if you used Duolingo as your primary method of learning Latin, you&#39;d finish it very quickly, and will have learned but a tiny fraction of what would be necessary to converse with someone in Latin, or read some classic works.&quot;,

    &#39;body&#39;: &#39;I\&#39;ve used Duolingo a bit as a refresher for Latin (I took it at uni some years ago), but I find it\&#39;s too focused on trying to be modern. As in, it gives you words for &quot;New York&quot; and &quot;Boston,&quot; but not a single word for &quot;kill.&quot; At least in the early lessons. If I can\&#39;t say &quot;Caesar executed the conspirators,&quot; what\&#39;s the point?\n\nAnd as others have said, Duo doesn\&#39;t really teach grammar. So if you don\&#39;t know the grammatical rules, it\&#39;s hard to learn. And if you do know the grammatical rules, it\&#39;s incredibly boring.&#39;,

Also, the Arabic and Esperanto ones are incredible, they developed a whole new way to teach Arabic and I really liked it. The Mandarin one on the other hand, sucks q&quot;,

    &#39;body&#39;: &quot;Just wanted to also add my voice of support for the Lingua Latina Per Se Illustrata series. It&#39;s genuinely one of the greatest language learning resources I&#39;ve ever seen, for any language. You can purchase the book on Amazon (and I&#39;d recommend you do!), but it&#39;s also quite easy to find a PDF if you&#39;d like to just briefly see what it&#39;s like.\n\nI find the best way to study is to focus on reading through the book, and when you come across some grammatical concept that you&#39;re not able to easily infer, consult a grammar source. While learning grammar is very important, explicitly trying to memorize grammatical features without context is probably the worst way to go about it. Best of luck!&quot;,

    &#39;body&#39;: &#39;Just to offer you another perspective, it\&#39;s very possible to make good progress in Latin without explicit grammar instruction being your main focus. You can instead focus on reading lots of material that gradually gets more grammatically complex, so that you slowly internalize grammar concepts in a more &quot;natural&quot; way. To my knowledge this method of language acquisition is actually the best supported by research, and the Lingua Latina series that\&#39;s very popular on this sub is a great example of it. It allows you to actually *read* Latin, not just translate it in your head - there is a big difference!\n\n\nDuolingo definitely won\&#39;t teach you incorrect grammar or anything, even if it\&#39;s true that the conversational focus at the beginning won\&#39;t prepare you well for the vocabulary in most &quot;real&quot; Latin. Give it a try and if you enjoy it, that\&#39;s great. Eventually you\&#39;ll need to move on to something else, since I\&#39;m pretty sure that duolingo only teaches the indicative mood and present tense of verbs.&#39;,

    &#39;body&#39;: &#39;I don’t like it because to me, the point of Latin, the way to really have fun with it, the way to really understand it, is learning the grammar. If you learn with the Duolingo method, with pseudo-immersion in conversational sentences, not only will you not get the vocabulary you need for something like Caesar, you won’t know the grammar rules. That’s where Latin’s rich, and that’s where it’s valuable. Don’t skip out on it. \n\nI have used the Memoria Press curriculum but studied by myself, not in a classroom. I think that’s a great resource if you can’t take a class, and I’d definitely recommend looking into it. Best of luck to you!&#39;,

    &#39;body&#39;: &#39;I write in New Latin mostly; don\&#39;t try to keep to any particular era, really, as long as I write in the exact, the idiomatic Latin (which I fail at, horribly).  I\&#39;ll use words if they\&#39;re in the dictionary (of course stuff like Du Conge doesn\&#39;t count).  As for *style*, and that is of course a matter of personal taste, I like the way *Palæstra Latina* was written, and Joseph Mir\&#39;s style in particular.  In other words, Neo-Latin with Mediæval influences, from the mouth of a Spaniard (which is close enough to French that I can smell it in there).  Although Peter Needham was a good, no, a *great* teacher, his style is too ponderous for me, like rock slabs falling into place.\n\nThat\&#39;s the thing─many of my British mates speak (at least some) Latin :P  (and correct me on using *credo, &quot;because only the French say \&#39;je crois\&#39;&quot;)* Then there\&#39;s Boris Johnson who (no joke) reads Martial in the original to fall asleep.  Or at least he did 10 years ago when he was constituency MP for... Henley-on-Thames, I think.&#39;,

    &#39;body&#39;: &quot;I wholeheartedly agree with you here - but seems to me that sometimes you try to stretch the definition of good style by including in it usage that is incompatible with the classical usage, and in so doing attempt to give yourself more space to play with. I think this approach instead makes it more difficult to find a style that works. Of course it&#39;s too facile to reduce all Latin to classical, but in order to learn other styles, I think it&#39;s a pre-requisite to define a starting point. Words and constructions don&#39;t change meanings one by one, and what works in one type of Latin won&#39;t make any sense, or will make a different sense in another type. Mastering different styles means being able to use each one at will; mixing them together randomly is the opposite of mastery.&quot;,

    &#39;body&#39;: &#39;My opinion on this has a similar conclusion to yours, though from slightly different premises.  First, yes, dogmatically &quot;freezing&quot; the vocab of Latin at the fall of the Roman Empire just reïnforces the perception that it\&#39;s a dead language---well, really, at that point it\&#39;s no longer a perception, it\&#39;s a fact, because a dead language is one to which new words and new concepts are no longer being added, and new content is not being produced in quantity.  Second, those of us that *do* write and talk Latinly about modern life will use Steel Age words like «birotarius» and «autocinetum», and Atomic Age words like «computator», in addition to the Iron Age words with which we\&#39;re all familiar.  To turn around and say, well, we\&#39;re not going to use Dark Age/Middle Age words is essentially a denial of the evolution of languages, even as you\&#39;re proving the evolution of languages.\n\nThird, and I didn\&#39;t see you mention anything resembling this (whether or not because you disagree), adding to the Latin vocabulary also allows for so-called *elegant variation*.  I was taught that it\&#39;s bad form to use the same noun twice or more in a row to refer to the same thing; either you replace it with a pronoun, or you use a synonym.  If there\&#39;s only one word for the object to which «ræda» refers, well, so much for that idea.  A lot of authors (especially in English) will write an article, let\&#39;s say on the phænomenon of combustion, and you scan it and see &quot;fire... fire... fire... fire... fire&quot;.  In fact, the Wikipedia article on fire uses that specific word 187 times, even in situations where &quot;flame&quot; would be fine, or &quot;combustion&quot;, or &quot;breakaway oxidation&quot;.&#39;,

You\&#39;re right, of course, except for when you said I used my feeling for English; I did, but not exhaustively, in fact I principally used my feeling for French.  «Dans l\&#39;espace de deux minutes» is a very French way of saying that; ditto for «usque ad vos», which is a Latin calque of «selon vous».  I also thought in Czech and German occasionally, as unlike English, those languages actually *have inflexions.*\n\nIf they are what I think they are (i.e. &quot;She told me *that*...&quot;), my first instinct was to use indirect statements in «quod» format, but I actually changed my mind after writing my post... guess I shouldn\&#39;t second-guess myself so much.&#39;,

    &#39;body&#39;: &#39;*Usō, -āre* is only used in Medieval Latin as a calque of the evolved Romance forms from a vulgar Latin frequentative **ūsō* &amp;lt; *ūsus* + *-ō*. In Classical Latin, the deponent *ūtor, ūtī* would be used. \n\nIn response to OP\&#39;s question, *pēnsō, -āre* is indeed a Classical Latin word, a frequentative form of *pendō, pendere*, from it\&#39;s past participle *pēnsus*. I would consider it a synonym of *putō*, but not of *crēdō*. As far as I can tell, *crēdō* and *pensō* are only synonymous in Medieval Latin, again supplanting its evolved uses in modern Romance languages. For example, Spanish *creer* and *pensar* are frequently used synonymously to express &quot;to think (that...),&quot; but it is not so in Classical Latin. I do think, though, that *putō* is far more commonly used, at least in Classical Latin, to mean &quot;to consider&quot; than is *pēnsō*. I would really define both as, &quot;to think about&quot; rather than, &quot;to think.&quot;&#39;,

    &#39;body&#39;: &quot;As for the question at hand, I don&#39;t have too much of a problem with it, in fact I think later forms can lend a sort of liveliness to Latin, giving it more of the feeling of a modern, living language. As a general principle, I think it best to use what classical words exist and know their strict significations, and only to supplement them where there is a need, since it is the classical standard to which Latin tends ever to revert, but then I gather that your purpose with the language is a little different to most people&#39;s.\n\nAre you sure that *usare* has any real currency, or even exists? There is *usitare* or *usitari*, but I can&#39;t find *usare* in a dictionary.&quot;,

    &#39;body&#39;: &#39;I think you have other more pressing problems that keep you from showing good latinity, such as: not using any sort of indirect statement (whether the more classical acc. + inf. or the later quod/quia/quoniam variety) where it is called for; making \&#39;me\&#39; a direct object of \&#39;dicere\&#39;; using the accusative after \&#39;in\&#39; where the ablative is wanted; the phrases \&#39;longitudinem temporis bis minutæ\&#39;, \&#39;in media aevi\&#39; and \&#39;in loco sermonem\&#39;; \&#39;bonem\&#39; in the wrong declension; the title of your post; several others. We really shouldn\&#39;t attempt to say things like \&#39;in the first place\&#39; literally in Latin.\n\nYou give the appearance of having acquired an ability to write quickly not by developing a good feeling for Latin grammar, syntax, idiom, and word choice, but by being content to write using your feeling for English.\n\nEdit:\n\nI\&#39;m no great composer of Latin, but below is my attempt to rewrite your post with better latinity without destroying your style.

    &#39;body&#39;: &#39;Sorry, I don\&#39;t quite follow. It\&#39;s metrical verse, even if what exactly it is a metrical verse in is unclear (few things are easier than composing metrical gibberish with a few foreign words thrown in). It was composed as all other Plautine verse. Verse was obviously composed orally, then written down, that is to say, transcribed. How natural (whatever that means) a particular piece of verse is depends on many factors, but for our purposes all of it was produced by a native speaker for a native audience of theater-goers, so as natural as any verse can be.\n\nI don\&#39;t understand what elese you might mean by &quot;transcribe&quot; other than to describe the way all verse without exception was written (I don\&#39;t think the *cento* was invented yet). I don\&#39;t understand what you mean by &quot;dogmatic practice of elision&quot;. What is dogmatic about it? This doesn\&#39;t make sense to me any more than talking about a dogmatic practice of stress in English. It\&#39;s a speech phenomenon enshrined in the artistic represenation of the rhythmical patterns of speech, which is poetry.\n\nYou clearly must be making some sort of assumptions about some sort of assumed artificiality of Plautus\&#39; speech, and arguing against that. Do you suppose you could explain what those assumptions are and why you\&#39;re making them?&#39;,

Seems plausible and not much of a leap. Given this, the assertion that Plautus might &quot;transcribe&quot; natural speech and that it would violate a dogmatic practice of ellision isn\&#39;t really much of a surprise.\n\nThe violation of ellision by pauses is a natural practice of normal speech, Plautus and Terence merely approximate the natural, as all great artists do.&#39;,

    &#39;body&#39;: &quot;(Latin is marvelous, but not dead.)\n\nIf you&#39;re simply asking me which works written in Latin I find to be the best: there are very many of them, including de rerum natura by Lucretius, the surviving works of Sallust and Horace, the Metamorphoses of Ovid, The Golden Ass by Apuleius,  the Vulgate Bible, consolatione philosophiae by Boethius, the history of the Crusades by William of Tyre, Petrarch&#39;s letters and ethica by Spinoza, and I could go on and on. Each one of those will give a thoughtful person much to ponder.&quot;,

    &#39;body&#39;: &#39;Capitalization doesn\&#39;t change the meaning. Since it stands by itself, punctuation isn\&#39;t required either. \n\nAlso, latin is pretty flexible than other languages in terms of word organization, so you can put the verb &quot;sto&quot; in the end as well. &quot;pro veritate sto&quot; is 100% correct, and would\&#39;ve probably been preferred by the Romans. Just something you can take into consideration.\n\nIf you\&#39;re going for the most authentic ancient Latin format, you can change the phrase to all capitalized and add interpucts between words. \n\n&quot;PRO·VERITATE·STO&quot; is the most accurate representation of ancient Latin I believe.\n\nLike I said before, it\&#39;s flexible and comes down to personal preference.

    &#39;body&#39;: &quot;Most of the sense in things you read will come from the vocabulary, and if you don&#39;t know most of the vocab reading can be very painful. I suspect this is what you&#39;re missing, especially if you are now encountering some original Latin material.\n\nIn the long term, the best way to learn vocab is to read thousands of pages of level appropriate material (tell me if you want suggestions). Start as soon as you can.\n\nIn the short term you can get by with intensive use of flashcards/spaced repetition. Focus on the 1000 or so most common words as well as the specific words in the texts you have to read.&quot;,

    &#39;body&#39;: &#39;The direct translation of &quot;mentes tuorum visita&quot; is &quot;enter thy souls&quot;. The English translation in your link is modified for the meter and rhyme. As &quot;thy souls&quot; refers to &quot;the souls of thy people&quot;, &quot;thine own&quot; sounds almost incorrect. &quot;invade&quot; is also used in an obscure sense, which just means &quot;enter&quot;. Interestingly, this sense is derived from Latinism in English, hence &quot;invade&quot; is interpreted as the same as &quot;in-vadere&quot; in Latin, which can have a non-offensive sense.&#39;,

    &#39;body&#39;: &#39;Yes, it would literally be something like: &quot;visit the minds of your own&quot;, or more understandably: &quot;enter the minds of those who are yours&quot;. *Tuorum* is plural genitive of &quot;thy&quot;. *Mentes tuorum* is thus &quot;the minds of thine owns&quot;, the implication being &quot;the minds of thine own men and women.&quot;\n\n*Pectora,* singular *pectus*, literally means &quot;chest&quot; or &quot;breast&quot; but is here figuratively used to mean &quot;heart&quot; or even &quot;soul&quot;, as the chest is the seat of heart and, according to ancient belief, the seat of the soul.\n\nSo a literal translation could be:\n\n&amp;gt;Come Creator Spirit / visit the minds of your own \\[people\\] / fill with heavenly grace / the chests (or: hearts) which you have created.\n\nThe translation provided on that site is a poetic translation. It\&#39;s a good translation, but not completely literal, as it tries to fit the meter and be singable to the same melody as the original Latin hymn.\n\nEDIT: added clarification&#39;,

    &#39;body&#39;: &#39;Nope, is not. A locative for the first declination can be used only for name of cities or for names of little islands (that cannot contain more than one city). It has also a slightly different meaning. In the sentence Italiae doesn\&#39;t mean &quot;in Italy&quot; (and it can\&#39;t, for Italia isn\&#39;t a city) but meant &quot;of Italy&quot; as &quot;is a city of Italy&quot;.&#39;,

    &#39;body&#39;: &#39;Use the participle to condense a relative(who)/ temporal(while/when/after)/ causal (because)/ conditional (if)/ concessive (although) clause to better expand the action of the modified noun (coordinating participles and verbs is a good way to expand the style of your Latin writing). You do not have to use a participle in this way, but it is generally expressing one of these meanings in a solidly condensed way. \n\nUse the gerund/gerundive to explain how something is done in simple terms.&#39;,

Actually I think &quot;Eldus&quot; is my first choice, if I don\&#39;t use &quot;dryas&quot;, because Tolkien intends the English word &quot;elf&quot; to be derived from the Elvish word &quot;Eldar&quot; in his internal history. But my question is really about if we use &quot;dryas&quot;, would the Romans find it extremely awkward in their cultural context, like this expression &quot;rex dryadum bellicosus&quot;?&#39;,

    &#39;body&#39;: &#39;I think I may have some helpful input! Despite Latin not having an explicit system that differentiates between the progressive and simple present (like we do in English), there are some classes of verbs that can express different aspectual meanings. Allow me to explain. There are some verbs and verb-forms called &quot;frequentative&quot;, meaning that the particular spelling of some verbs conveys an idea of the action the verb describes as frequently occurring.\n\nFor example, &quot;*Nam qui* \\[...\\] ***venditat*** *patriam&quot;* (Rhetorica ad Herennium, 15.23). The verb here &quot;*vendito*&quot; means &quot;to offer again and again for sale&quot; (definition from Lewis and Short). As opposed to a verb like &quot;*prodo*, *prodere*&quot; which in this context would just mean &quot;to sell&quot; without that sense of perpetuity/frequency. This same idea isn\&#39;t exclusive to the present however, for example &quot;*iactatus*&quot; conveys a frequentative meaning in the opening lines of the *Aeneid*.\n\nThere are also *inchoative* verbs, which expresses on an aspectual level the idea of &quot;entering or beginning a specific state&quot;. In Latin, inchoative verbs have the root &quot;-sco&quot; in them, like *cresco* and *ardesco*. *Ardesco* (to kindle, to set aflame) is a good example because it is noticeably distinct from *ardeo* (to burn). \n\nI hope this is at all helpful. And my apologies if this has already been said in the previous comments!&#39;,

    &#39;body&#39;: &#39;Verb tenses developed as a corruption of Proto-Indo-European verb aspects. This is the only way you can ever understand &quot;why&quot;. I could recommend some good reading about this, but unfortunately it\&#39;s all in German.\n\nAnyway, the point is, you shouldn\&#39;t ask why Latin doesn\&#39;t have certain present tense/aspect combinations. You should be grateful for what it does have. As far as languages go, Latin is actually highly productive here. Old English, for example, has only two tenses. You can hint at the others by using some adverbs, but ultimately the &quot;span&quot; of the language (in the linear algebra sense) just doesn\&#39;t include a lot of the  meanings which Latin can reach with its 6 tenses. But why should it? Surely it seems almost certain that the space of all possible sentences in a natural human language is smaller than the space of all possible expressible meanings. And obviously different languages will span different extents of that space, depending on the intelligence and creativity of the speakers in whose society each language was created.\n\nYou should think of different languages as &quot;coordinate systems&quot; for different (non-isomorphic) *strict* subspaces of a fundamental &quot;meaning space&quot;.&#39;,

    &#39;body&#39;: &quot;To give you some context on what&#39;s going on, flavius belisarius clearly knows quite a bit about Latin, he is just not acknowledging the variation in Latin usage over the centuries, and specifically that the usage of the church can differ quite a bit from the Latin of Romans who lived in the time of Julius Caesar.\n\nFor instance, words like *creatura* and *producere*, which are quite similar to the English words *creature* and *produce*, would not have meant *creature* nor *produce* to a speaker of Latin living in Rome in the first century BCE. So if you&#39;re translating a text written by Caesar or one of his contemporaries, rendering *creatura* as *creature*, and *producere* as *produce* would be wrong. These are easy mistakes to make when you&#39;re a beginner in Latin, since the Latin and English words are so similar, and flavius belisarius is quite right to look out for them.\n\nHowever, Latin developed over the centuries. By the time the church came along and indeed became an important and powerful institution, some words had acquired new meanings. So in Christian texts, a word like *creature* often does mean *creature*, and *producere* does mean *produce*. In fact, the meaning of the English words *creature* and *produce* comes from the Latin words that they have been derived from.\n\nAs it happens, the Latin literature of the first century BCE has been hailed as the pinnacle of everything written in the language for centuries. Indeed, this period is known as the age of Classical Latin. As a result, many people have looked down upon Latin that adheres to usage and style standards of later centuries. This has been remedied somewhat nowadays, but Classical Latin is still often the basis for how Latin is taught. I think that goes some way to explaining why people here are quick to point out when someone is adhering too strictly to Classical Latin rules.\n\nSimilarly, a word like *dignatus* comes from a verb that had some variation in how its different grammatical forms were used. I won&#39;t bother you with the details, but the prayer uses one form, whereas flavius belisarius only acknowledges the other form as correct.\n\nFinally, I have to admit that I do not have a source at hand to verify that *cerevisa* is a correct alternative spelling of *cerevisia*, which means *beer*. However, the word *cerevisia* has variously been written as *cerevesia* and *cervesia*, so I personally wouldn&#39;t worry about another variant spelling.\n\n**edit:** That turned out to be a little more context than I intended, so feel free to ignore. But since you&#39;d followed the discussion that far, I thought I might as well go into a little deeper.&quot;,

    &#39;body&#39;: &quot;Just to add, the English translation is quite a faithful rendering of the Latin. The only thing I can think of that might be of some interest, is the word rendered as *peace (in soul).* In the Latin, that is *(animae) tutelam*. As it happens, the word *tutela* implies a kind of safeguard that I wouldn&#39;t necessarily think of when reading the English *peace*. But that is not really of any consequence. When you&#39;re translating, you&#39;re gonna deviate somewhat. And the difference here is actually very slight when you compare it to other translations.&quot;,

Also, *dignor* is a deponent verb, so *dignatus es* simply means *has deigned*. Finally, *producere* can mean *to lead out*, but it&#39;s far more idiomatic to render it as *to bring forth*, or indeed *to produce*.\n\nI do agree that the plus sign in the middle of *benedic* is weird.&quot;,

This is...dense Latin. \n\nThe second sentence (&quot;Propterea praefatus...&quot;) is maybe slightly more straightforward:\n\n&amp;gt;Therefore the aforementioned Theoderic (von Appeltern, not Pannekuc) assured, before us, these guarantors with the stipulation and surety owed: Lord William von Hirne, nobleman, and the aforementioned Theodericus Pannekuc, soldier, and, under oath, he obligated himself, that he himself will place his brother John von Appeltern, and his sister, and not all those familiar to him in this region or desiring nearby, to judge the likewise reconciled inheritance, and he will make to delay from the assail of the previously mentioned good men and of those of the abbot and anywhere the vexation of the assembly.\n\nMaybe you can make more sense of this considering where you got the document from. But it sounds to me like people are arguing over an inheritance and this guy Theoderic von Appeltern was called before the council and told to sort things out. Incidentally, which of the people mentioned is your ancestor? If I have time later I\&#39;ll do the last sentence.&#39;,

It really helps build vocabulary and develop the ability to read Latin, rather than just translate it. (Note on reading Latin, pp. 48, 49, Henle First Year Latin).&#39;,

    &#39;body&#39;: &quot;In ecclesiastical Latin, vowel length is not phonemic, meaning short and long vowels are not distinguished like they are in classical Latin. I do not know of any examples at all of macrons being used in writing according to the ecclesiastical pronunciation. The most I&#39;ve seen is the acute accent used to mark syllable stress, but that isn&#39;t the same. If *Memoria* does indeed use macrons, which strikes me as quite unusual, I&#39;m not surprised they don&#39;t conform to their use in classical Latin. \n\nAs for your second question, *Marīis* is not a form of Marīa. If you are referring to the ablative plural, this would be *Marīīs*, with two long ī&#39;s. However, you might encounter *-iī* or *-iīs* fairly frequently among first- and second-declension nouns. This, for me, though, is not as hard, because the stress can&#39;t be on that syllable.\n\nAnd yes, the Romans referred to the nominative case as the *cāsus nōminātīvus*, the genitive as the *cāsus genitīvus* and so on and so forth. Singular and plural are *singulāris* and *plūrālis*, respectively.&quot;,

Knowing that use of the genitive and accusative with verbs of remembering and forgetting is always good, but the later response is absolutely right. Mortem is acc; mori is a deponent infinitive. (Unless you’re trying to remember a kind of tree ;) ) Unless I am mistaken, memento mori is the common phrase. The accusative with verbs of remembering is generally an older construction (Plautus, et al.); from Augustus onward, the genitive is more regular. Some people argue that the accusative is “more vivid”. Anyway. Just wanted to apologize.&#39;,

The ablative doesn’t exist in German of course and in translating to German there are two situations.\n\nWhen the ablative is the object of a preposition, you find the corresponding German preposition and then use the case appropriate to that preposition (often dative). For other ablative constructions (without prepositions), you’re probably going to have to write a prepositional phrase or relative clause in German.\n\nCan you give an example of a Latin sentence that gives you trouble?&#39;,

    &#39;body&#39;: &quot;No, I get it. After 4 years of high school Spanish, my teacher gently told me that I really had no aptitude or future with languages, so when I got to college and still needed to meet my language requirement, I needed a language that I didn&#39;t have to speak or understand verbally. Latin was the obvious choice. We used Wheelock and...I flunked. Totally didn&#39;t understand a word the entire semester. Since I also flunked all my *other* courses that semester, too, I needed to bring my grades up immediately, and I made a Hail Mary pass by deciding to take intensive Latin (i.e. two full semesters&#39; worth) in a single, 8-week summer session, and I got an A+. Something just clicked. The combination of endless tables to memorize and those really quaint Sententiae Antiquae just suddenly clicked, and I&#39;d found my calling. I followed Latin with Greek, then French, then German, etc.\n\nI&#39;ve just finished refreshing the German I took 20+ years ago by completing the Duolingo German course, and it&#39;s been much harder for me to grasp the language the Duolingo way, as opposed to memorizing conjugations and declensions, although I suspect that I&#39;m in the minority there. I *need* to know the grammatical principles behind everything.\n\nI&#39;ve always wanted to go back to my high school Spanish teacher to tell her that I really _did_, in fact, have a future in languages. :)&quot;,

It was a lot easier when I began trying to just go with a simple flow, then work out the rules using Wheelock&#39;s as a reference.\n\nMight just be my dumb ass unable to handle proper Latin, though.&quot;,

As others have said it&#39;s Very incomplete at the moment, only present tense for verbs, not all noun declensions/case covered etc. Also just generally seemed very rushed to me, not all the words have voice recordings but some do, the pronunciations are odd, the recordings are often very hard to hear/echoey/poorly edited, or the voice would switch between different people in the middle of the same sentence\n\nI would only recommend if an absolute beginner is looking to supplement learning. If it gets more people learning and interested in Latin then great, but particularly with this course duolingo  Needs to be supplemented with other materials if you want to make any progress with the language&quot;,

It is certainly a Minimal Viable Product.  I would like if it had more Latin in it that is used everyday like Legal Terms and Biology, or even some mythology which has a section but it&#39;s very basic. They don&#39;t even have some of the most famous Latin Phrases *Et tu, Brute?* anyone.\n\nAlso, it&#39;s strangely obsessed with Parrots, drunk Parrots, killing Parrots, etc.&quot;,

    &#39;body&#39;: &quot;It is a very incomplete course. Right now it is in beta and most Latin grammar is simply untouched. Verb tenses are the most complicated piece of Latin grammar, and at the moment it just doesn&#39;t really teach them at all. It just teaches the present tense. The assumption is that more content will be added, but it&#39;s clearly at most one third of the way there. It may be useful as a supplement for someone who is in their first semester of Latin or who wants a review of the basics, but it won&#39;t carry you very far.\n\nSome people are also driven up the wall by the emphasis it puts on weasels and parrots drunkenly cavorting and engaging in perfidious acts (not even joking). There are two issues. One is that parrot and weasel are not especially commonly used words in Latin. The second is that because they aren&#39;t commonly used, they are likely to trip people up when they are trying to test out of skills, so people who are pretty good at Latin end up having to do a lot of basic review just because they missed some simple words when they wouldn&#39;t if Duolingo used more common words like sheep or dog or bird as prominently as it uses parrot. I don&#39;t personally mind, as I believe that parrots and weasels were chosen because they are off the wall and drunken parrots are funnier than other kinds of drunken animals and it makes the sentences a bit more memorable to new learners, but I do understand the frustration.&quot;,

    &#39;body&#39;: &#39;Hey Luke, thanks for the mention and an interesting question - I\&#39;ve actually had it on and off my mind to find a proper answer to it.\n\nA lot of the time, the phrase is used in English to simply mean *nunc intelligō, nunc rem teneō, ratiōnem capiō etc.*\n\nIf you want to say &quot;it\&#39;s reasonable to&quot;, u/Kingshorsey has covered that - I like *pār est* as the most neutral expression. &quot;it\&#39;s more reasonable to, it\&#39;s preferrable to&quot; is *potius, praestat* etc.\n\nIf you want &quot;I think you reason correctly&quot;, the usual course of action would be to pick any of the usual expressions of agreement. For some variety there\&#39;s *rem loqueris/fābulāris*, or more colloquially *est istuc quidem aliquid*, or less colloquially *probābiliter dīcis,* or stronger *bene ratiōcināris, prūdenter/sapienter loqueris*.\n\nThe opposite of the above, again, apart from the usual expressions of disagreement, is *nōn convenit/quadrat, id quod dīcis nōn constat, hau consentāneum est, vix ita* *~~mē~~* *mihi persuādēre possum* or stronger yet, *apsurda dīcis*.\n\nAs far as I can see, *sensum habēre* means &quot;to possess reason, be able to think and understand&quot;, and *sensum facere* &quot;to result in discernible meaning, to be understandable&quot;.\n\nIn short, I think the trick is to look through the ambiguous English phrase (as all such overused phrases tend to be) and try to grasp its precise meaning in the given context, at which point finding the right Latin expression becomes quite trivial.&#39;,

    &#39;body&#39;: &#39;u/ilritorno confirms that “fa senso” does not mean “hace sentido” —   but in any case, neither the Italian nor the Spanish are something we want to “translate” since they are idiomatic expressions. Surely the Latin language has *something*, or perhaps a few phrases, that are Roman equivalents. And some other commenters have given us a few to work with. \n\nIf you check PHI you won’t find sēnsum habet/facit meaning “it makes sense”:\n\n\nhttps://latin.packhum.org/search?q=sensum+habet\n\n\nhttps://latin.packhum.org/search?q=sensum+facit\n\nSeneca’s words here have a different meaning.&#39;,

    &#39;body&#39;: &#39;At least here in central Italy, &quot;ha senso&quot; e &quot;fa senso&quot; do not the mean the same thing. Here in Tuscany &quot;fa senso&quot; or rather &quot;mi fa senso&quot;, are used to express a reaction to something that is not pleasing. Someone could say &quot;mi fa senso&quot; to react to the sight of some blood, or to the sight of a bad wound, or to a recipe that appears disgusting (i could say &quot;mi fa senso&quot; when presented with *lumache in umido*).&#39;,

    &#39;body&#39;: &#39;While &quot;ha senso&quot; is appropriate to mean, &quot;it makes sense,&quot; I have only seen &quot;fa senso&quot; in Italian used to mean the same thing, and the phrase in Spanish is, &quot;hace sentido,&quot; an exact parallel of the latter. I don\&#39;t see &quot;sēnsum facit&quot; as a problematic translation.&#39;,

    &#39;body&#39;: &quot;Here a couple ideas you could try:\n\nOne option would be to pretend it&#39;s borrowed from Greek and then use Greek endings, so you could have Vaaou for the genitive. Also Greek is far more open to long strings of vowels like you have in Vaaos.\n\nYou could also arbitrarily make it third declension with Vaaosis as the genitive.\n\nThird idea is to sidestep your issue by forming an adjective, and have something akin to &#39;profunda Vaaosia&#39;&quot;,

    &#39;body&#39;: &quot;I think as long as vaaos is mentioned earlier in the book, especially using different forms, they&#39;ll know by seeing it before. Also I reccomend having a glossary in the back of your book like most Latin books I&#39;ve seen have - if you dont already - because then they can say oh what&#39;s this? Check the glossary they got it. Include different forms of the word as well in the glossary&quot;,

If you look up Vaai in Latin you won&#39;t find anything, but if you know it&#39;s in Vaaos you&#39;ll know that it is not a real word that&#39;s been translated into Latin. An English reader isn&#39;t going to know how to translate Vaai out of Latin (or anything else for that matter, but they can use a translator -- knowing that, referencing Vaaos will then make sense as to why it wouldn&#39;t translate).&quot;,

    &#39;body&#39;: &#39;Hi! So.... I’m interested in a phrase (I’m thinking about getting it on a custom piece of merchandise) but I wanted to make sure I’m understanding this correctly. “Ego sum dignus” is translated to “I am worthy”. But I’ve also seen it translated as “I am not worthy”. Is the latter correct? I’m thinking the only way that could be right is because of some sort of literary device? It’s been over 10 years since I’ve taken Latin and about 14 or 15 years since I’ve taken a Latin literature class. I would greatly appreciate any feedback!\n\nThanks!!&#39;,

As part of a creative writing project I&#39;m involved in, I&#39;ve been trying to find a suitable epithet for a lesbian version of the goddess Venus. For Aphrodite, the epithet that I managed to find is *Gynaikerastria*, which should (I hope) translate to *Lover of Women*. How would one go about Latinizing the term *Gynaikerastria* to turn it into an epithet of Venus? Would *Gynaecerastria* be the term&#39;s Latinized form, or would a different word entirely be used instead?\n\nThank you in advance!&quot;,

A lot of translations of the word solus comes up as &quot;only&quot; rather than &quot;alone&quot;. Is solus the best word to capture the english meaning of &quot;alone&quot;?\n\nAnd &quot;Born alone, die alone&quot; is just a short form of something like &quot;You are born alone, and you die alone.&quot; Born alone, die alone isn\&#39;t meant so much to be a sentence. Just short form. I don\&#39;t know how that affects how it would be rendered in latin, but given what those implied words are, that might affect the form the latin words are in.&#39;,

    &#39;body&#39;: &#39;Thanks a lot. I have red a bit about *ut* but it seems to indicate more a logical step of action than a goal. I believe *ad* is more in line with the idea.\n\nLooking back at the french and English sentence I noticed a difference in the sens that the french one is using the infinitive while the English is imperative. The french one being more impersonal, having no subject, and thus being directed at everyone. English is not my first language so I am unsure if this subtlety can also be found in some way in English. Can the imperative of Latin also imply this impersonality and sense of obligation?&#39;,

But, based on L&amp;amp;S entries, it looks like the devoicing would have happened already in the Greek. \n\nUnder *papae*, L&amp;amp;S has &quot;păpae, interj., = παπαί&quot;, but under *babae* it says &quot;băbae   or păpae, interj., = βαβαί or παπαί&quot;.

    &#39;body&#39;: &#39;In addition to my other comment: you seek something not rigid. But in fact nearly all songs in English follow very fundamental, rather rigid structure which tends to come naturally to most song writers because they are native speakers. But the nature of Latin at an elemental level is quite different, and I would say more complex (or perhaps, it has numerous differences which must be taken into account). The way to make these foreign language differences intuitive is to study Latin poetry very intensely.&#39;,

The video has a great singer and I like the format. \n\nThat video though allows me to hear crucial things: long/short note contrast is not applied to the Latin long/short syllable contrasts. Elisions are inconsistent. Stresses occur on non stressed syllables. \n\nSo after you have internalized partially by rote memory at a bare, bare minimum the Viva Voce poem selection series linked above, you should then study the truly advanced (and necessarily advanced for this kind of work) translations by u/RumakRasna. We can’t really have a common frame of reference until you have. Keep up the good work!&#39;,

    &#39;body&#39;: &#39;Thanks for those resources!  You\&#39;ve piqued my interest in classical poetry, though I must confess I don\&#39;t quite understand how that level of familiarity with ancient literary form(s) is that important to the task at hand.  I could become an expert at composing Ovidian-style verses, but I doubt that will be much help in translating/adapting a Disney song that doesn\&#39;t follow any Ovidian or other historical meter.\n\nMaybe you could explain in greater detail how such knowledge helped you and/or Rumak compose the lyrics for &quot;Et Nīl Est.&quot;\n\nMaintaining the rhyme scheme and syllable count per line while also taking minimal liberties with meaning is already a delicate balancing act.  For me at least, I think adhering to a canonical structure would make it virtually impossible to arrive at a satisfactory result. Then again, assuming this is exactly what you\&#39;ve achieved with &quot;Et Nīl Est&quot; and the like, that may just be because I\&#39;ve never tried, in which case, thank you for quite possibly giving me the impetus to attempt it!  Also, congratulations, because that\&#39;s quite a feat!\n\nOn the flip side, I\&#39;m not really convinced that it\&#39;s a bad idea to apply more modern literary forms to Latin.  This seems to me like just another part of what it means to treat it like a &quot;living&quot; language.\n\nIf you\&#39;re curious, [this Latin rendition of &quot;My Heart Will Go On,&quot;](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqO2zGW1_5E) which I actually managed to get recorded, is perhaps the best example of my current overall approach (if you can forgive the singer\&#39;s thick English accent, particularly with the word &quot;sēcūrē&quot;).  It\&#39;s quite old, so there might be a few parts that I\&#39;d do a bit differently if I had the opportunity to re-record it, but it works at least well enough to show how I usually tackle Disney songs.\n\nOne of my more recent translations that hasn\&#39;t been sung yet is [&quot;Audiar&quot; (&quot;Speechless,&quot; from the 2019 remake of Aladdin)](https://www.reddit.com/r/latin/comments/byoqcx/princess_jasmines_new_song_speechless_in_latin/).  I think this one is the closest I\&#39;ve come yet to a classical rhythm.  At the very least, the stress imposed by the melody manages to align more often with actual word stress.&#39;,

    &#39;body&#39;: &#39;Right! So, you’ll have to study Roman verse forms pretty closely. I recommend staring with Ovid’s love poems, because they’re in the commonest meter: alternating dactylic hexameter and pentameter. Then study the varieties used by Catullus. After that internalizing a few of Horace and understanding Plautine meter will be sufficient preparation. Memorizing a few poems from each author will be important. If you commit large parts of the following in this playlist to memory, you’ll be in good shape; this is how I began: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLE1C14EC1E01387D1&#39;,

Classical literary form was just never a focus of mine in learning the language.  As long as the grammar is right and the pronunciation is the best it can be, I&#39;m not that meticulous about adhering to attested poetic structure(s).&quot;,

    &#39;body&#39;: &#39;I remember my teacher spent half a class period going over this single line in my AP Latin class. Even 13 years later, I remember it because it was the first line read that we stumbled over. Actually, lines 8-11 were difficult for us because of the shift from the introduction to addressing the Muse directly. Plus, it was the second day of the class, and my teacher taught us using Ecce Romani in the years leading up to AP Latin, so we didn’t have a ton of exposure to Vergil or poetry in general. But she was an amazing teacher, and she really helped us understand the Aeneid. There were 8 people in my AP Latin class, and no one scored below a 4 on the exam. RIP.\n\nAnyway, I believe as a class we settled on something like “is there so much anger in heavenly minds?”&#39;,

It\&#39;s not an ad hoc thing.  It\&#39;s called the Traditional English Pronunciation, and it\&#39;s used in the British courts of law and Parliament, among other places.  You can look it up if you like.\n\nWhen you put Latin through English TTS, Google uses this system as well.  It\&#39;s the only &quot;faithful&quot; Latin pronunciation you\&#39;ll get on Google (as in, people actually talk this way), unfortunately it\&#39;s not faithful to the Senate and the People of Rome.\n\nAs a user of Traditional English Pronunciation in general, I have found this resource invaluable in serving as a sort of robotic dialect coach.&#39;,

And among their TTS for other languages, I personally found Polish&amp;gt;German=Dutch&amp;gt;Spanish&amp;gt;Portuguese&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;Italian, when I put in some Latin text.\n\nFor TTS dedicated to Latin, have a look at these links:\n\n[https://loquarblog.wordpress.com/2017/09/29/classical-latin-tts-an-inelegant-solution-to-the-dearth-of-quality-latin-audio/](https://loquarblog.wordpress.com/2017/09/29/classical-latin-tts-an-inelegant-solution-to-the-dearth-of-quality-latin-audio/)\n\n[http://nesrad.blogspot.com/2017/09/classical-latin-text-to-speech-tts.html](http://nesrad.blogspot.com/2017/09/classical-latin-text-to-speech-tts.html)&#39;,

    &#39;body&#39;: &#39;I agree with most points, I don\&#39;t think of it as a shortcut because I still need to do all of the same work of learning the vocab and grammar, just approaching it from a different angle.\n\nFor example, kids think &quot;See spot run&quot; is fun but adults no longer do.\n\nLLPSI is an ingenious idea, I think it would work even better if it introduced some vocabulary with translations because this would allow it to use more interesting stories, by being so absolutist about no translations, it locked itself into very basic, boring stories cause they had to keep them predictable. However, I do find it useful and as I mentioned to u/NasusSyrae, I\&#39;ll keep using it alongside with bilingual books.\n\nMy native language is Russian so I\&#39;m familiar with inflections at endings of words.\n\nI find that in most classics I\&#39;ve read there\&#39;s enough variation of difficulty, as a recent example, I was reading 2nd part of Les Miserables in french and there\&#39;s around 150 pages that deal with trap being set for Jean Valjean, and even though my French is very basic, it was a breeze to read. A few chapters after that were excrutiatingly difficult. Another one I\&#39;m reading now in french is Dostoevsky\&#39;s Possessed, and find most of it super easy to follow (after having read it in Russian recently).\n\nOTOH I found it very hard to read Nietzche in German, and I\&#39;m almost certain any other philosophy works would be even more difficult.&#39;,

    &#39;body&#39;: &#39;&amp;gt;It seems a bit boring\n\nI don\&#39;t want to dissuade you from learning Latin as quickly as you can, and in as entertaining a manner as you can, but, as with mastering most skills, there really aren\&#39;t shortcuts.\n\nYou need to expose yourself to the language on a regular basis, and ratchet up the complexity over time as you get comfortable with the simpler material. There\&#39;s a reason, beyond their overall level of cognitive development, why we start kids out with &quot;See Spot run&quot; before they proceed to James Joyce.\n\nLLPSI is constructed in a graded fashion to do exactly this, while an arbitrary Latin classic isn\&#39;t. It is true that some classics are easier reads than others, but, within a given work there\&#39;s not necessarily much variation, so one needs to have reached a certain level to approach it and benefit from reading it in the first place.\n\n&amp;gt;after picking up some initial vocabulary, I like to learn by reading bilingual books\n\nLatin is an inflected language, meaning that the endings of words vary based on the grammatical role of each word in a sentence. You can see a vestige of this in the English pronouns &quot;he&quot; (subject) and &quot;him&quot; (object). For this reason, you might also benefit from some basic grammar instruction before moving on to reading these bilingual books. If you go the LLPSI route, it provides some explicit grammar instruction, in Latin, at the end of each chapter.&#39;,

    &#39;body&#39;: &#39;That sounds very appealing, where can I buy a bilingual edition of this book?\n\nI think I somewhat disagree and somewhat agree: poetry is very hard to appreciate at a high level in any language. I\&#39;m not very familiar with poetry in any language so I can\&#39;t say more than that. As far as classics of literature, I have to disagree, while there are exceptions, it\&#39;s not very hard to learn from reading them. In many cases they will have passages that are not overly complex in vocab or structure. One famous example is Hamlet\&#39;s &quot;To be or not to be - that is the question&quot;.\n\nThat\&#39;s also true from my own experience reading classics in languages that I know at a beginner level. (Of course the goal being not to understand and appreciate these works fully or perfectly but to learn the language from them).&#39;,

    &#39;body&#39;: &quot;Eh, think of Erasmus as gateway drug to Classical Latin.  Erasmus read a ton of classical literature (understatement) and his Latin is classicized.   It&#39;s not the Latin of a medieval historian.  He wrote his colloquia with this literature in mind and employed turns off phrase from Classical literature in order to familiarize his students with it.  Think about how hard it is to pick up literature of the highest register in any language (especially poetry) and learn from that unless you are already intimately familiar with a very similar language (hint, Italian is no where near close enough to Latin for native Italians to do this).  It&#39;s one of the problems with Classical language pedagogy--that people think they can and should do that.&quot;,

    &#39;body&#39;: &quot;If you are determined to learn in this manner, there are bilingual editions of various colloquia that are much more suitable to a beginner (though in my mind still not the most suitable resource we have).  I know there are English-Latin editions of some of Erasmus&#39;s colloquia because I&#39;ve read them.  You can find them on Google books or internet archive.  I would also look for bilingual editions of Corderius, Vives, and Schottenius.   I know Scorpio Martianus reads some of them in Latin and English on his Youtube channel.  I can&#39;t remember what is public and just for patrons though.  Speaking of stuff publicly available on his youtube channel, this brings me to what you should really be doing to learn Latin:  reading LLPSI.   Search this subreddit, the resources document in the sidebar, and his youtube channel for info on this textbook series.&quot;,

    &#39;body&#39;: &quot;The Bloomsbury companion to Lexicography puts it at [7.5mil words in Classical latin](https://books.google.be/books?id=09JBAgAAQBAJ&amp;amp;pg=PA152&amp;amp;lpg=PA152) (i.e up to 200AD).  Most Roman latin however is from late antiquity, St. Augustine (354-430AD) is easily the most copiously surviving Roman Latin author - Leaving around 5.3mil words, by himself nearly rivaling the size of the Classical corpus - his contemporary St Jerome (347-420AD) around 3.2mil (these figures taken from the [corpus corporum website, in the Patrologia Latina section](http://www.mlat.uzh.ch/MLS/xanfang.php?corpus=2&amp;amp;lang=0)). By comparison the classical author with the largest word count is Cicero at around 1.1mil words - the only other classical author who comes close is Livy at around 0.5mil. Without doing an exact count I would say there are not more than 100 authors down to 200AD.  \nI&#39;m failing to find the reference, but I think I&#39;ve seen the late antique corpus placed at about 4x the size of the classical corpus, putting the total size of Roman literature at about ~30-40mil words. The vast majority of extant Latin however was written in the middle ages and early modern era.  \n  \nWith regards to variety - I am not hugely familiar with Roman literature (esp. classical), but I have leafed through *A History of Roman Literature from Livius Andronicus to Boethius* by Michael von Albrecht and it seemed very informative with regard to these matters. From the top of my head we have all manner of poetry (epic, amatory, comedy, didactic, satire etc.), lots of oratory, epistles, philosophy &amp;amp; theology (esp in late antiquity), history and biography, technical works (medicine, architecture, agriculture) &amp;amp; various other academic subjects (grammar, rhetoric, law). Small amount of imaginative prose fiction.  We have much more variety from the middle ages and later (see: Medieval Latin: An introduction and bibliographical guide)).&quot;,

    &#39;body&#39;: &#39;That\&#39;s really an impressive and well thoughted translation! I think it isn\&#39;t easy to interpret Shakespeare\&#39;s original text, and sometimes we have to decide whether we should translate some phrase litterally despite the obscurity and rarity of the Latin phrase resulted, or massively rephrase the text to make the translation more regular and readable in Latin. I had a brief look into the original text and found some points that could perhaps be helpful.\n\n&amp;gt; The merciless Macdonwald--Worthy to be a rebel, for to thatThe multiplying villanies of nature Do swarm upon him--from the Western Isles Of kerns and gallowglasses is supplied \n\nI think this should be read as &quot;the villanies do swarm upon him&quot; rather than &quot;the gallowglasses do swarm upon him&quot;, and both kerns and gallowglasses are infantries. I don\&#39;t think cavalries are very useful in mountainous Scotland. *adiubatur*\\-&amp;gt;*adiuvatur* (typo)\n\n *At in rixa suam damnatam Tyche inridebat-&amp;gt;* *At ad rixam suam damnatam Tyche (*maybe *Fortuna?) adridebat. inridere* means &quot;laugh at, redicule&quot;*, adridere* means &quot;smile at, please&quot;.\n\n&amp;gt; Which smoked with bloody execution\n\nI think &quot;execution&quot; here means &quot;bloodshed, slaughter&quot;, but *carnificina* means &quot;execution (sentenced), torture&quot;, so perhaps we can change *carnificina cruda* to a classic expression *caede et cruore.*\n\n&amp;gt;  \nO valiant cousin! worthy gentleman! \n\nI read this as an exclamation (accusative) rather than direct address (vocative), as I think the pretended audience is the sergeant rather than Macbeth.\n\n &quot;E mari in quo sol reflexionem suam incipit in eo tempore vernali&quot; and &quot;nova problemata facta de gaudio victoriae lata erant&quot; need to be refined a bit.\n\n &quot;dum ille coniunx Bellonae ... aequavit,&quot; *Dum+Indicative* means &quot;while, as long as&quot;, for &quot;till that..&quot; it should be *dum+Subjunctive.*\n\n&amp;gt; Nor would we deign him burial of his men Till he disbursed at Saint Colme\&#39;s inch Ten thousand dollars to our general use. \n\nBoth clauses in &quot; Nolebamus permittere milites Suos inferi donec recedebat is Ad insulam Columbae et dare myrias Aureos nobis.&quot; need some revision.\n\n&amp;gt; No more that thane of Cawdor shall deceive our bosom interest: go pronounce his present death,And with his former title greet Macbeth. \n\nThis should be read as &quot;No more that thane of Cawdor shall harm the interest of Scotland, kill him, and give his former title ( thane of Cawdor) to Macbeth.&quot; I found it\&#39;s somehow hard to read out what Duncan wants to do from the Latin translation.&#39;,

In Latin the dative is usually the recipient of the action of the verb in some way- as in\n\n“I give the bag to David”\n\nThe bag is the object and is accusative in Latin, while David is the recipient and thus would be in the dative.\n\n“I did that for Jim.”\n\nThough not receiving anything physically, Jim is still the person the action is being done for and so would be dative in Latin.\n\nFor “I hit Bob with my bag” the “with my bag” would always be in the ablative in Latin.&#39;,

In &quot;Bob has the bag,&quot; the bag would be in the accusative.\n\nGenitive: indicates possession.

In Latin, this would literally say &quot;the bag is to me,&quot; or, &quot;the bag belongs to me&quot;. It\&#39;s the other way around compared to English, so this can be a bit confusing. Try to use &quot;belongs to&quot; to figure out how the sentence works.\n\nDative: indicates the person being talked to, or the object used to do something. &quot;I hit Bob with my bag&quot;, I = nominative, Bob = accusative, bag = dative. &quot;I talk to Bob,&quot; I = nominative, Bob = dative.\n\nAblative: I\&#39;m not too familiar with this as I\&#39;ve mainly studied Greek in college, so it\&#39;s a little harder to explain, but it can do several things.\n\n\\- It always comes after certain prepositions.\n\n\\- It can indicate what you\&#39;re using to do something, just like a dative might.\n\n\\- It can indicate time or space, like &quot;In September&quot;, where September would be in the ablative as it\&#39;s telling you when something happened.\n\n\\- It can indicate where something is coming from, in which case it\&#39;s translated by \&#39;from\&#39;. &quot;Bob is from Rome,&quot; Rome = ablative.&#39;,

    &#39;body&#39;: &#39;The esse is the infinitive completing tendit and fovet. Here it’s an objective infinitive as it is completing the verbal action of the direct object (hoc) rather than the subject (dea). \n\n i.e. “ this (the city Karthage), the goddess tends and cultivates TO BE...” \n\n\nAn additional hint is that it is serving as a sort of equal sign between hoc and regnum.\n\n“ the goddess tends HOC to be a REGNUM”. \n\n\nHope this was clear enough without giving it all away! If you have more questions about this passage feel free to comment back.&#39;,

    &#39;body&#39;: &quot;Does one need to preclude the other? That is to say, you can&#39;t always tell what a word should mean in the context you encounter it. Of course, you can type it into a corpus search, but I&#39;m not sure learners have the time to do that with every new word they encounter. Aside from that, there are plenty of authors who have some favoured words that they use with a specific meaning. I&#39;d say that in these cases, it&#39;s quite useful to take the shortcut of a mnemonic to remember the meaning at first, until you&#39;ve come across it enough times to have it firmly assigned to memory.\n\nTo be clear, I think I agree with your disapproval of vocab lists in general. But I think that this kind of mnemonics can make learning new words a little bit easier as well as more fun. So as long as they don&#39;t get in the way of eventually learning the word &#39;properly&#39;, I think there&#39;s a place for mnemonics.&quot;,

    &#39;body&#39;: &quot;Not entirely sure what any of that meant, but Catullus and Horace do have a meter and it is integral to the poem. In Horace he goes out of his way to introduce a meter appropriate or historical to the poem (see poems 1-9 of Bk1. Odes 1-9. which match the meters of the Canon of Nine) It looks to you to be &#39;free-verse&#39; because you can&#39;t&#39; read the meter.\n\nWhen Catullus writes epic eg. 64 it is written in the metre of epic, Dactylic hexameter. Rhyme is not a feature of Greek or Roman poetry, outside of very rare half-rhymes, it is a trope taken from arabic. The stress in Horace and Catullus is essential, one of the reasons your Latin sounded wrong was that you were giving the incorrect lengths to vowels and diphthongs.\n\nYou also seem confused between metre and syllables, syllabic content is still important, a perfect line of dactylic hexametre has 17 syllables, but it is not necessary to have 17.\n\n(I assume you&#39;re talking about Catullus 16, too. Classical poetry couldn&#39;t be further from dry, it is usually about sex, love, politics, mythology and war!)\n\nIn &#39;The Sudent&#39;s Catullus&#39; by Garrison, he has an appendix that explains meter in the best terms I&#39;ve come across.&quot;,

Now you read the one where Catullus was flipping the bird to the two wankers who called him a sissy... there&#39;s no rhyme scheme, no metre either, not in the conventional sense.\n\nOf course, French poetry has no metre at all to speak of (it&#39;s like Japanese *haiku,* where you just count the syllables per line)... but it&#39;s still poetry and not prose.  Catullus, Horace, etc don&#39;t fall in that mould, either, they seem a bit more *structured* than that, sort of midway between English and French verse.&quot;,

    &#39;body&#39;: &#39;Well, this deserves a little bit more explanation.  I grew up speaking English, French, and Spanish as mother tongues (i.e. from birth), then had friends from the Czech Republic at about 5-6 y.o. who introduced me to that language.  When I found mater\&#39;s Latin books, I jumped into them (I was a voracious reader even back then at such a tender age), and somehow deduced, and I\&#39;m talking ætat 7 or 8, that Latin has the vocabulary of French and the declensions of Czech.  That was when I began practicing with mater, though just a little bit.  We\&#39;re for the most part a legal/political family (mater\&#39;s an architect though) so in my teens I started going to court and to the Inns for fun.  Then law school.  \n\nI practiced verbally quite a bit during those years, read Harrius Potter in Latin when it came out (Mr Needham taught half my family, the ones blessed with a membrum virile)... but never as a serious study thing.\n\nThe Horace came much later; I\&#39;d never done any verse practice during that time, and mostly satisfied myself with Neo-Latin compositions and such... but I decided to see what all the fuss about Ancient Roman poetry was about.\n\nThere was that one poem by a fellow named Catullus, I can\&#39;t remember the name of it or even the incipit, but it sounded strikingly similar to T. S. Eliot\&#39;s &quot;The Triumph of Bullshit&quot;---essentially, a five-foot-tall two-finger salute directed at the man\&#39;s critics.  Well, I found it moderately funny, somewhat inspiring in view of my own life, and figured that some of the Classical stuff shouldn\&#39;t be all that dry, if that\&#39;s how he wrote.&#39;,

On top of that, I mostly *read* it, rather than *spoke* it, so even this Anglicised version didn&#39;t stick in my head, though I can get the sense of it (read or spoken) just fine.  I figured, though, with the classicists outweighing the lawyers and politicians (even in England, where Greats is taken by the poli-sci types, you&#39;ll find more people aspiring to the academical work rather than the political) by quite a bit, the English pronunciation won&#39;t cut it if Latin becomes more popular as I&#39;m sure it will.&quot;,

    &#39;body&#39;: &quot;I don&#39;t really know what the traditional pronunciation is supposed to sound like, but in other respects, I would suggest focusing on fluidity and finding some rhythm in the text; it sort of sounds like you&#39;re speaking the text one word at a time instead of allowing it to flow into sentences. \n\nIn terms of achieving that, I recommend that you aim to speak with purpose and visualise in front of you the audience that text was intended for.&quot;,

    &#39;body&#39;: &quot;Saw the other two guys saying how horrible this was and decided to give a good listen, and let me say that it is not that bad and I&#39;ll try to give some constructive criticism.\nFirst of all, you&#39;re probably american, and it&#39;s really hard for an american to make some sounds, latin is easier to pronounce when your mother tongue comes from latin (specially italian). Because you&#39;ve still not mastered the pronunciation (mostly the &#39;r&#39; sounds), try speaking clearer and slower (a few words were also mispronounced).\nIf you&#39;re really determined to have an awesome spoken latin, I&#39;m sure that you&#39;re gonna get there someday! Don&#39;t be discouraged!\nIf you want to have a 10/10 spoken latin, I&#39;d suggest trying to learn italian, of course you don&#39;t need to be fluent in it, but try listening and learning some sounds that aren&#39;t present in american english, it really makes a difference.\nHope to have helped! Keep going and you&#39;re gonna get there!&quot;,

If you have access to a university library or a large disposable income, they are however well worth checking out (you could also have better luck at a used bookstore, but IME they tend to either not have them or to still be pretty expensive).\n\nIf that isn&#39;t an option for you, Perseus, a web database through Uchicago, might also work; IIRC it&#39;s possible to get English in a sidebar of the Latin page or vice versa, or just have the two open in back to back tabs or on different monitors.

Ofc linguists know thousands of latin words and have read many simpler and less impressive texts. But what is known in the mainstream colture is a collection of phrases from well known and talented orators. So they were written to be impactful, meaningful, oftentimes compact but powerful. \nIt’s like reading a sentence from obama, or gandhi, or einsten and wonder why english, hindu, or germans are such powerful languages. They are jot per se, you just use as your frame of reference a collection of sentences that were written to be impressive. Sure we can have a debate on phonology and why certain languages sound better, clearer, more intense or more sensual. While it’s true that latin is a rather straightforward language in terms of pronunciation (and that might make is sound powerful and clear to listeners) I don’t think it’s that relevant.&#39;,

Personally, I consider macrons as just part of the spelling of words like accents in Spanish, as they are critical for proper (Classical)  pronunciation, grammar, and understanding (for instance the difference between the Latin word for &quot;grandma&quot; and &quot;anus&quot; is a single macron), but plenty of Latinists don\&#39;t bother with them at all. Presumably, you\&#39;re not pursuing exact Classical accuracy, so you can dispense with them if you wish.&#39;,

    &#39;body&#39;: &#39;For me, it’s always easiest to find the verb and noun and build the sentence up from there. If you’ve been taking classes for many years now, you notice how the noun and verb are often separated by a bunch of other adjectives and adverbs. It’s hard, because in English the noun and verb are always so close together, but try looking at it in a bigger picture sort of way. I used to do what you do, but this year I’ve had to adjust how I read, and I started with immediately finding the verb. Hope this helps!\nPs- you’re in good company, abl and dat cases suck. I still haven’t fully memorized my declensions.&#39;,

    &#39;body&#39;: &#39;&amp;gt;In an ideal world, having the meta-knowledge of grammar would indeed be irrelevant. However, the application of knowing, for example, the names for all the ablatives is something one encounters without fail in the contexts of both AP and IB programs as well as the general course of study throughout college. With a view toward composition of prose, knowing the ins and outs of declension and morphology as well as the correct grammatical situation for each case is also quite useful for students (but this is a corner case, at least in the US, with most prose composition courses limited to graduate school). If a teacher fails to teach these things rigorously then the students will fall to achieve at a higher level. Unless the academic expectations change wholesale, one has to teach the things which this example from Professor Bracey disregards. Teachers have to work within the system for students to succeed in relatively objective, standardized testing. This is, I agree, a bad thing for literacy and fluency.  \n&amp;gt;  \n&amp;gt;I am generally advising self-learners  from my own experiences and encounters with the US system and goals in  mind (AP Latin, Latin SAT subject test, IB, general college Latin  courses). I learned via Wheelock\&#39;s, taught at university with it, then  switched to the Intensive Course, which we used for the intensive summer  courses. Then, with the program I inherited, Our Latin Heritage was the  standard. Within our network (about 60 schools, 40 of which have robust  Latin programs), the data for the AP exam is that the LLPSI kids do  average (55% pass rates), the Cambrige, Wheelock\&#39;s or Latin for the New  Millennium do quite poorly (32%), and the OLH do the best (87%), so it  appears to be the right text for the system, i.e. for AP Latin  curriculum. However, there is the National Latin Exam ([NLE.org](https://nle.org/))  which tests a form of Latin that seems best covered by LLPSI, as it  asks for no grammar by name but rather for case/conjugation by context.\n\nNotwithstanding the petty nonsense we may disagree on, this is the real *gravamen* of the discussion and I am happy that we see eye to eye on this.\n\nNote, however, that I never said anything against objective, standardised testing (in principle).  I think it\&#39;s the only way to go (and I do mean standardised tests, scored by an exam board, not ad-hoc in-school exams, as tends to be the case in Canada).  I\&#39;m not even against &quot;working within the system&quot; or &quot;teaching to the test&quot;, in principle.  The *caveat*, though, is that the subject matter under examination needs to be factually **useful.**  It also needs to be oriented in favour of **results** rather than process.\n\nI\&#39;ll use maths here as an example, specifically multiplication.  The traditional way is to stack two numbers, multiply every digit in the bottom number by every  digit in the top number, and do addition at the end. If you’re  multiplying two four-digit numbers, you end up performing sixteen smaller  multiplications to produce a final product.  In 1960, though, the Karatsuba Method was invented; it is just an alternative process for multiplication, so the product (by definition) is the same as with the traditional method, but it saves *a lot* of ink where large numbers are concerned.\n\nNow, if I sit a maths exam, get every answer right, but I get docked marks for using the Karatsuba Method, **that is a poorly designed exam**.  The skill under examination (i.e. multiplication) is a useful one to have, but since it doesn\&#39;t matter whether students do it the old way or the new way, they should be scored only on the correctness of the answer.\n\nA translation-based exam, to me at least, seems to be the best way to test Latin knowledge.  Possibly with a conversational component, to see how well students can think on the fly, but that\&#39;s my revivalistic instincts peeking through.&#39;,

That\&#39;s almost by definition.  It is impossible to teach someone who\&#39;s never before been exposed to Latin from an article/poem/journal entry that wasn\&#39;t expressly written to teach them.  Milk before meat; all foreign-language courses have been structured at the beginning, and they always will be.  The difference lies in what happens **after** that.\n\n&amp;gt;In regard to the Vatican stuff - I am  rather close to Jesuits who often recommend the living Latin programs  which seems too esoteric for most. I also had a friend go through a  spoken Latin-only department at Kentucky, which was bizarre.\n\nLatin Immersion is a niche programme and, like all foreign-language Immersion courses, always will be.  As for Living Latin being esoteric, it depends on what is being meant.  I am a Living Latinist in the sense that I encourage students to read modern Latin compositions, and to learn the vocab for *light bulb, computer, car*, et cætera. \n\nSome people take it way too far, covering Elvis in Latin or doing the Lion King/Moana, but it\&#39;s no more esoteric, in my view, than Cheryl Lowe\&#39;s opinions on language.  Seriously, [you should read them](https://www.memoriapress.com/articles/natural-method-not-natural/).  In spite of *all the scientific research* demonstrating that the *only* evidence-based method for foreign-language acquisition is the Natural Method, she says this:\n\n&amp;amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;gt;Turning to the other two methods, #1 the grammar-first method and #2  the grammar-translation method, why is the former superior to the  latter? To begin with, the grammar-first method **is the traditional  method** that was used in the golden age of classical education, from the  Renaissance to the dawn of the 20th century. It is only in the last  century that the grammar-translation method began to supplant the  grammar-first method, a period which coincided with a drastic decline in  Latin learning.\n\nLet\&#39;s count the fallacies there.  Number one - appeal to tradition.  If something is &quot;traditional&quot;, it must be the best, right?  Wrong.  Number two - correlation does not imply causation, and she says it does.\n\n&amp;gt;In contrast, the grammar-first method focuses on and delights in the  grammar as an interesting subject in itself that does not need to be  rushed over in a hurry to get to translation, just as a good mathematics  program delights in and focuses on arithmetic rather than something to  be endured and rushed over in a hurry to get to algebra. \n\nAnyone who delights in grammar as an interesting subject in itself, well, *dico eum raram esse avem in terris*.\n\n&amp;gt;**It is a failure of modern education** that lower order skills, such as  grammar and arithmetic, are denigrated and sacrificed for the higher  order skills of translation and higher math. This is a poor trade-off  that ultimately causes most students to reach a plateau in our two  difficult and cumulative subjects, languages and mathematics.  \n&amp;gt;  \n&amp;gt;There is a reason why non-Western cultures (particularly India,  China, Japan) consistently out-perform our students in mathematics. They  do not have our bias against memorization, drill, and basics. They  reach a higher level because they have the patience to build a strong  foundation.\n\nThey\&#39;re also flogging reprints of the old *Latin First/Second/Third/Fourth Year* books by Robert Henle, which for the record are not bad resources at all... but the way they\&#39;re being marketed makes me a bit sick to my stomach.\n\n&amp;gt;Have you ever wondered what Latin books looked like before school texts were dumbed down? Originally published in 1945, the *Henle Latin Series* **teaches  Latin the traditional way**. \xa0For students who are beginning Latin  studies in 9th grade or above, the first half of Henle I along with our *Teacher Manual* is the perfect beginning Latin program.  \n&amp;gt;  \n&amp;gt;*Henle* is a Catholic text, but its superiority as a teaching  resource and the outstanding benefits of its Christian perspective far  outweigh the very occasional picture or reference that a Protestant  might wish to ignore.\n\nI know Latinists tend to be on the conservative side; I am, as well, though I try to divorce the Latin language from Ancient Roman culture, so as to broaden the appeal of both.  By this I mean that a) Latin is a method of *communication* that can be used anywhere by anyone, at any time in history after its invention, and being &quot;typecast&quot; as &quot;the language of the Ancient Romans&quot; hampers its adoption in this regard; and b) lots of classicists are no good with languages and are using the degree as an ersatz Poli Sci course (in fact, in English universities, the default is to consider Poli Sci as just a different &quot;track&quot; of Greats).\n\nNotwithstanding any and all of the above, the unrelenting, fallacious appeals to tradition demonstrate two things about Memoria Press: *primo*, a frankly **stunning** degree of irony, given that the company apotheosises the trivium, which consists of grammar, rhetoric, and **logic**, and *secundo*, that they\&#39;ve cornered the market in reactionary troglodytes.\n\n&amp;gt;Thanks for your perspective. It is  interesting to see a different point of view. I just hope we both agree  on the opposition to Google Translate and Duolingo Latin.\n\nBut of course.  It all has to do with the way Google\&#39;s artificial &quot;intelligence&quot; is best &quot;nourished&quot;.  Essentially, Google feeds its computers with literature that has translations into many languages, and the A.I. gets **exponentially** smarter, a) the more languages that piece of literature is translated into and b) the more text is in its &quot;corpus&quot; for that particular language.  A 50,000 word document written in English, French, German, and Spanish is worth an order of magnitude more to the computer than a 20,000 document written in English and French.\n\nOne of the most useful works for Google Translate is, of course, the Bible; it has a Latin translation.  Even more useful, though, is European Union legislation... which is famously wordy (the Treaty of Lisbon, its more-or-less constitution, has 65,000 words) and published in 23 languages.  Unfortunately, none of those 23 languages is Latin, and until it\&#39;s added to the list, Google Translate will remain comparatively shitty.&#39;,

I also had a friend go through a spoken Latin-only department at Kentucky, which was bizarre.\n\nI am generally advising self-learners from my own experiences and encounters with the US system and goals in mind (AP Latin, Latin SAT subject test, IB, general college Latin courses). I learned via Wheelock\&#39;s, taught at university with it, then switched to the Intensive Course, which we used for the intensive summer courses. Then, with the program I inherited, Our Latin Heritage was the standard. Within our network (about 60 schools, 40 of which have robust Latin programs), the data for the AP exam is that the LLPSI kids do average (55% pass rates), the Cambrige, Wheelock\&#39;s or Latin for the New Millennium do quite poorly (32%), and the OLH do the best (87%), so it appears to be the right text for the system, i.e. for AP Latin curriculum. However, there is the National Latin Exam ([NLE.org](https://NLE.org)) which tests a form of Latin that seems best covered by LLPSI, as it asks for no grammar by name but rather for case/conjugation by context.\n\nThanks for your perspective. It is interesting to see a different point of view. I just hope we both agree on the opposition to Google Translate and Duolingo Latin.\n\n&amp;amp;#x200B;\n\nEdit:\n\nAlso, perhaps these links may help with your reader? \n\n[http://johnpiazza.net/latin\\_hist\\_reader.pdf](http://johnpiazza.net/latin_hist_reader.pdf)\n\n[http://johnpiazza.net/latin\\_myth\\_reader.pdf](http://johnpiazza.net/latin_myth_reader.pdf)\n\nPlus these are always good for free and useful reading\n\n[https://www.openbookpublishers.com/section/31/1](https://www.openbookpublishers.com/section/31/1)\n\n[https://geoffreysteadman.com/](https://geoffreysteadman.com/)\n\n[http://dcc.dickinson.edu/](http://dcc.dickinson.edu/)&#39;,

    &#39;body&#39;: &#39;My knowledge of any American curricula is absolutely *nil*, so excuse me if I seem to be arguing from a point of ignorance here.  I also was not, in any way, denigrating or de-prioritising &quot;translation and reading comprehension&quot;; in fact, I view that as **the cornerstone** of any foreign language course, Latin not excluded.\n\nThe typical high-school or university Latin exam in Britain is to be handed several extracts, half in English and half in Latin, and made to produce serviceable translations thereof.  From this standpoint, then, a focus on reading comprehension is paramount; you can\&#39;t translate the thing if you don\&#39;t understand it.\n\nI don\&#39;t know where you got the idea that I\&#39;m advocating matching the student\&#39;s fluency in Latin to his English ability.  This would only be possible in an immersion/bilingual environment from the call to post, and not many people are so blessed.  The professor mentioned the matching thing *obiter*, but the *ratio decidendi*, as it were, is that there is undue emphasis on what you called the meta-knowledge of grammar, to the detriment of comprehension.  On the other hand, it sounds like the professor\&#39;s trying to harmonise with a very American sort of political choir, one that focuses on skin colour as the key factor in group identity; this is a perspective I don\&#39;t share, nor does it play well in Canada or the UK in general.\n\nYou and I, on the other hand, might have the same ideal scene in mind.  In fact, I think we entirely agree so far as the pupil\&#39;s skills on exam day are concerned; where we seem to disagree is how that pupil is best produced.  My intuition tells me that the best way to acquire Latin is through consumption and production of material; that is, reading, translating, writing, more or less in that order.  In English, the **children\&#39;s** primer *par excellence* is &quot;Fun with Dick and Jane&quot;, and the closest equivalent to that in the Latin language is «Lingua Latina per se Illustrata».  That, then, is what I suggest as one\&#39;s first classroom reader.\n\nAs for the meta-language of grammar bit, I\&#39;m not familiar enough with exam formats in the U.S.A. to be able to speak authoritatively.  Given an exam geared *totally* towards comprehension and translation, the student doesn\&#39;t need to know the **words** &quot;ablative absolute&quot;, he simply needs to know how to use the actual **concept** in communication.  In such an environment, declension and morphology can be learned intuitively, then applied flawlessly, without *necessarily* knowing the terminology.   If, on the other hand, there are multiple-choice questions that depend upon the pupil\&#39;s knowledge of grammatical strictures, well, so much for that idea.\n\nMoving right along.  When the pupil feels confident enough to read non-didactic texts (books, articles, plays), he **must be encouraged in this** as a matter of priority.  Of course, all pupils must eventually move up to non-didactic matter; in a sense, the Latin language is its own reward.  This is where things **really** get interesting, because there\&#39;s the possibility of a cross-training effect, as you mentioned.  At this point in the language-acquisition &quot;gradient&quot;, learning material either comes as long-form literature (with Latin it\&#39;s Horace, Ovid, Cicero, etc.) or anthologies of that same literature.  With a varied enough anthology, you very well might run into a situation where a pupil with an interest in regime change and coups asks for the works of Julius Cæsar as a means to indulging that interest... and while he\&#39;s indulging himself, he\&#39;s learning Latin.\n\nI can\&#39;t put too fine a point on that.  My own interest in science fiction was aroused by &quot;Lose Now, Pay Later&quot; by Carol Farley, a short story that was included in an anthology-format basal reader.  As far as English goes, there must be a myriad textbooks in this genre.  In the Latin language?  Nil.  [I had to formulate my own.](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1ztcJahCSTgpjNM-kfITgfOYbqOzCogtv)\n\nWhile many of the contributors to my homemade basal reader are affiliated with the Catholic Church (Claretian monks in particular), I\&#39;d hardly call it &quot;Vatican stuff&quot;, given that the content is 100% secular, from the airport to the bank, Snow White to Jack and the Beanstalk.  It must be a stellar example of cosmic irony that the monks could write engaging, informative, and at times funny prose and poems (*pueri rident et discunt* after all!), while everything published by [Memoria Press](https://www.memoriapress.com/curriculum/latin/) (a Christian textbook publisher) is an industrial-strength soporific.  Cheryl Lowe should never have been allowed anywhere near a classroom.\n\nIn case you\&#39;re not familiar with Cheryl Lowe or the *Forms* Latin textbooks, she basically took the Grammar/Translation approach, and got rid of the translation.  That\&#39;s right, Grammar First.  She wasn\&#39;t satisfied with risking kids getting bored of Latin... she wanted to guarantee they **hate** it for the rest of their lives!\n\nRegardless, assuming four years of Latin instruction, I\&#39;d use LLPSI as the introductory text, Familia Romana plus my basal reader as the Year 2 texts, then the classics for Years 3 and 4.&#39;,

    &#39;body&#39;: &quot;I would find this valid if it were *totally* true. Is the OP trying to read for a hobby? Academics? \n\nThe focus of academic Latin in the US *is* for translation and reading comprehension. Anything else is almost disregarded or limited to JCL/ACL contests and hobbyists (mostly - there are living Latin groups, Vatican classes, University of Kentucky, cruises in Latin, etc.). While this focus on reading only is **terrible**, it only takes about 1.75 years of daily high school grammar instruction to get students reading through Caesar with ease; the grammar and morphology-based approach is not incompatible with reading. Another year or so and Cicero and Ovid are accessible. While this may not be entirely true in every setting, this has been a successful approach through my high school&#39;s honors program.\n\nIf you are starting with elementary children and working through graded readers, then yes, I suppose matching their current English skills and Latin skills would work, but by sophomore/junior year of high school, they are readily able to tackle tougher literature. Introducing juniors to Cicero while they are simultaneously in AP Language is a great way to reinforce rhetoric and style.  Critiquing the Aeneid as propaganda or learning about the Gallic suppression of information in DBG 6 while simultaneously reading 1984 in AP Literature is a perfect crossover.\n\nIn an ideal world, having the meta-knowledge of grammar would indeed be irrelevant. However, the application of knowing, for example, the names for all the ablatives is something one encounters without fail in the contexts of both AP and IB programs as well as the general course of study throughout college. With a view toward composition of prose, knowing the ins and outs of declension and morphology as well as the correct grammatical situation for each case is also quite useful for students (but this is a corner case, at least in the US, with most prose composition courses limited to graduate school). If a teacher fails to teach these things rigorously then the students will fall to achieve at a higher level. Unless the academic expectations change wholesale, one has to teach the things which this example from Professor Bracey disregards. Teachers have to work within the system for students to succeed in relatively objective, standardized testing. This is, I agree, a bad thing for literacy and fluency. \n\nWhile I do understand that Wheelock&#39;s is far and away the thinnest of the options I provided (and granted, 38 Latin Stories is a weak supplement), I still recommend reading it cover-to-cover as the Loci Antiqui and Loci Immutati (as well as the Wheelock&#39;s Latin Reader) are great springboards to reading fluency. Have you worked with either Latin: An Intensive Course or Our Latin Heritage? Both have extensive graded selections which really do exposes students to reading in a powerful way. Especially OLH 2, as it works through the variations of the Fabulae Faciles and a large survey of Caesar and other writers. While this may just be my experience from graduates coming out of our High School program, reading has been no problem for students doing 3 semesters of grammar/morphology/vocabulary with reading and then 5 semesters of reading/AP, so grain of salt and whatnot. \n\nIt is quite tough to teach a skill that ends up remaining mostly passive (reading) and rarely active (composition, conversation outside of Latin teacher meetups or University of Kentucky&#39;s grad program). However, the students who are really into the language will go above and beyond through extra curricular activities like JCL. Again this is biased toward a view at the US education system, with no active knowledge of any British curriculum (or Vatican stuff).&quot;,

    &#39;body&#39;: &#39;I strenuously advise against the grammar-translation method of learning, and therefore texts that use this approach.  It is a fossil.  Wheelock\&#39;s is a good reference---but that\&#39;s what it is, a REFERENCE.  Keep it on the shelf, and refer to it when you get stuck, but this is not a book to read cover-to-cover.  Instead, focus on the communicative and comprehensive aspect.  The idea is to understand THE LANGUAGE, not the rules of that language as an intellectual exercise in themselves.  Begin with something like Orberg\&#39;s Lingua Latina Per Se Illustrata, then start adding Latin source material (either some of the more basic classical authors, or Neo-Latin articles from Palaestra Latina) and make sure you understand it fully.  Translation is a good exercise; it\&#39;s the essence of foreign language acquisition, that you can read material or hear speech and know what it means.  \n\nProfessor John Bracey explains much better than I ever could:\n\nFor centuries now, the default approach to teaching Latin has been the grammar-translation approach. This approach generally consists of learning grammar rules, learning grammar terminology, memorizing paradigms, and translating Latin into English primarily to demonstrate grammatical accuracy. When you boil it down, the emphasis is on memorization and application of abstract grammatical formulae. This approach takes a language that was once spoken comfortably by people of all backgrounds, social classes, ages, etc. throughout the world and renders it into a complex linguistic jigsaw puzzle that requires an elite mathematical mind to decipher.\n\nThe challenge that the grammar-translation approach poses to inclusivity is that it takes language, something universally accessible to all, and creates a series of unnecessary and onerous roadblocks that render it accessible to only the few. For example, using a comprehension-based approach, with no direct grammar instruction, all of my 7th grade students were able to read novice-level chapter books in Latin by the end of the year. With a grammar-based approach, those same results would be considered totally invalid unless accompanied by the ability to decline mixed-declension adjective-noun pairings, or to identify the difference between ablative of means and an ablative of manner.&quot;&#39;,

This traditional pronunciation then became closely linked to the pronunciation of English, and as the pronunciation of English changed with time, the English pronunciation of Latin changed as well.\n\nUntil the beginning of the 19th century all English speakers used this pronunciation, including Roman Catholics for liturgical purposes.\n\n***\n\n^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&amp;amp;message=Excludeme&amp;amp;subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/latin/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot)   ^]\n^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28&#39;,

    &#39;body&#39;: &#39;Well, \&#39;\&#39;amice erudite mi\&#39;\&#39; (my learnèd friend), my own Latin pronunciation is the Traditional English variety (see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traditional_English_pronunciation_of_Latin and https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/cambridge-classical-journal/article/english-pronunciation-of-latin-its-rise-and-fall/A0860C6625BE5A0E45FD58A18797E6FB/core-reader).\n\nAs for forms of address, since we\&#39;re both lawyers: Learned applies to a litigator; Gallant applies to a veteran of the Forces; Honourable applies to a member of Parliament/Congress, or the son of a Peer of the Realm/Senator; Reverend applies to an Anglican/Episcopal minister; Right Honourable applies to a member of the Cabinet (you\&#39;d say the Administration) or a Peer of the Realm/Senator;  Most Honourable applies to a marquess; and Gracious applies to a duke.  And no, this is not just academic, there are barristers with hereditary titles, and then there are barristers with Ph.D.\&#39;s in theology.\n\nSo, in court or in politics, you\&#39;d address me as &quot;my honourable and learned friend&quot;, until mum karked it or Boris called me to the Front Bench (either/or), at which point you\&#39;d say &quot;my *right* honourable and learned friend&quot;.  I don\&#39;t know if you\&#39;ve been in the Service or not, but if you\&#39;re a vet, you\&#39;d be &quot;my learned and gallant friend&quot;.  (Classical) Latin doesn\&#39;t have these fine divisions of status, which is why it disconcerts me sometimes.  Even the great Pompey I\&#39;d be forced to call &quot;Gnæus Pompeius&quot;, instead of something more dignified.\n\nNow, Donatien Alphonse François de Sade (author of the simply amazing &quot;120 Days of Sodom&quot;) had never been a lawyer, but he is also known as the *Marquis* de Sade.  So if I could resurrect this great Frenchman, I\&#39;d call him &quot;my *most* honourable friend&quot;.  No learned; he\&#39;s not a lawyer.&#39;,

    &#39;body&#39;: &quot;In the Latin of the common lawyers, *baro et femina* (transparently calquing NorFr *baron et feme*) was the usual rubric under which they discussed what the American tradition would call &#39;domestic relations&#39;.  *Baro* in this context meant little more than &#39;man&#39; or &#39;husband&#39; under the Plantagenets.  My understanding is that the word became used as a title because at law it came to mean a freeholder who had no mesne lord, but held his land and tenancy directly from the King.  This, of course, was a heritable status.  \n\nI was a litigator, but practiced mostly in the appellate courts, which tends to involve very little courtroom performance in the USA.  I prefer to use the ecclesiastical/classical music pronunciation, because if you hear anyone speaking or singing in Latin, this is what you are likeliest to hear.&quot;,

When I was in law school, quite a few years ago, I was researching the origins of trial by jury and the several systems it replaced, mostly variations on ordeals or (for noblemen) trial by combat.  My conclusion was that it was a part of the Plantagenets&#39; attempts to wrest power from the Church, which administered the ordeals and as such got to control all the variables.  At any rate, reading quite a lot of practical Latin was required and I learned to appreciate the rough virtues of the style.&quot;,

This do much perplex me, and I did go presently home Betty whispering me behind *the tergo do her mari*, that if I would say that we did come home by water, *elle* could make up *la cose well satis*, and there in a sweat did walk in the entry *ante* my door, thinking what I should say *a my femme.*  \n&amp;gt;  \n&amp;gt;...  \n Thence after dinner I to White-hall with Sir W Berkely in his coach.

And *jo haze ella mettre su mano upon my πράγμα hasta hazerme hazer la cosa in su mano*.  *Pero ella no voulut permettre que je ponebam meam manum a ella*, but I don\&#39;t doubt that *άλλο χρόνο...*\n\nThat last bit\&#39;s somewhat complicated, but... &quot;And I let her put her hand on my thing, and she made me do the thing \\[cum\\] in her hand.

You&#39;re correct that other influences come into play too which are not accounted for by the resources I&#39;ve given you, but the most generally sufficient answer as to why Kreb&#39;s historical context treated Cicero the way that they did lies in these specific humanist debates. It&#39;s also the reason, e.g., that the classic *Bradley&#39;s Arnold* *only* shows as correct Latin attested in Cicero and omits non-ciceronian constructions (e.g. Livy&#39;s future paraphrastic: futurum esse).&quot;,

    &#39;body&#39;: &#39;Not only in the case of Latin but also in English, Spanish, French, Greek and many other languages, perhaps most other languages, there are those who wish to limit the vocabulary, and those who have no problem at all seeing the vocabulary expand, and this is based upon a fundamental philosophical disagreement about the nature of language. If one wants to fix a language and insist that a certain version, and no other, is the correct version of that language, this will involve limiting the vocabulary of that language. If one sees languages as things which are constantly changing, and sees the change as a good thing, a natural and healthy thing, and thinks that the notion of &quot;correctness&quot; is arbitrary and must change with usage, then that will involve welcoming a constant growth of vocabulary, from slang, from other languages, from science and technology, from the use of the language by non-native speakers, etc. I\&#39;m convinced that the second alternative is much more fun, as well as more relevant to the actual use of the language by all who speak, hear, read and write it.

Krebs lived right around the time of the birth of classical philology as we know it, whose aims might have resonated with Renaissance thinkers, but whose methods they would have found quite alien. Or am I completely wrong and we have ciceronianism to thank for the brief but immensely fruitful flowering of Latinity in 19th-early 20th century Germany?&quot;,

It is awesome to be able to map Cicero&#39;s vocabulary and grammar and try to get closer to it if we can (remembering that we are not Cicero and that Latin is a real language and not a made up thing by Cicero), as much as it doesn&#39;t make it harder to use Latin as a common language between us. Of course there are neologisms, it is a language from 2 thousand years ago. Are we really giving up on all historical progress and choosing to use huge weird circumlocutions as if some time traveling Roman needed to understand us?

There can be a few obvious arguments made in its defense.\n\nOne thing to consider is the word choice in poetry. I hope you can appreciate that in poetry no two words are replaceable, to use your example if an editor printed Shelley\&#39;s book and changed \&#39;not comprehensible\&#39; to \&#39;incomprehensible\&#39; and similar, where it doesn\&#39;t affect rhyme, you would cry foul.\n\n&amp;amp;#x200B;\n\nIt\&#39;s also a matter of a sliding scale, if you allow silver age synonyms, why not a few particularly handy middle age synonyms? Especially if they were used by medieval writers who tried to hew as close as possible to the classical style and word choices?\n\n&amp;amp;#x200B;\n\nIf a line has to be drawn somewhere, it\&#39;s a matter of personal intuition to choose the precise spot.\n\nI think you also perhaps exaggerate the significance of avoiding a single Ciceronian word, he might have considered the possibility of copying errors; some of Cicero\&#39;s writings were letters written hurriedly, etc. If he used 15k words, 1 word is just 7 thousandth of 1 percent of his vocabulary, so it can hardly be seen as &quot;not trusting even Cicero&quot;.\n\n&amp;amp;#x200B;\n\n\\[Edit: I forgot to add that while it makes sense to me, that doesn\&#39;t mean I agree with it. It just seems like one valid, on the surface, opinion as many others.\\]&#39;,

    &#39;body&#39;: &quot;Thanks for your professional answer! In fact, what I&#39;m afraid is-Did Krebs himself really believe and obey his rigid rules? Did he really think that using *non comprehensibilis* instead of *incomprehensibilis* would make him write proses better? I&#39;m confused by his ideas because these two words are almost the same to me, and though *incomprehensibilis* is a post-Augustan word, I believe Cicero would have coined it if necessary. After all, Cicero had made a lot of coinages.&quot;,

The simplest way to ensure that is to choose a narrow standard for everyone to emulate. \n\nWhen people think about Renaissance Latinity, they usually think of the artistic, expressive side.

It is dead because there is no native speaker anymore, the culture has died out, nobody hates, loves, or curses in Latin. There are no memories formed with it anymore.&quot;,

    &#39;body&#39;: &quot;It’s not just vocabulary. It&#39;s also style, sentence and paragraph structure, clausulae (rhythm to close a sentence), and so on.  Way back in the whenevers, call it last century to be kind to the elderly (I mean me), people were taught to write Latin of a certain type.  It wasn’t about learning to read Latin of different types and different periods,  it was about writing without conflating words or constructions from different genre or different periods.\n\nWhatever Caesar did was fine.  Anything Cicero did regularly was probably OK, but words or constructions from his letters shouldn’t be used (so his letters weren’t read until quite late in our courses).  Anything found only in poetry was disallowed.  When silver age Latin was read, we were expected to note how it differed from the model we should aim for in our own writing.\n\nSo ultimately it’s about the purpose of language teaching.  If the educators&#39; aim is to train to students to write a certain Latin style, then dictionaries and grammars reflect that.  When the purpose changes, as it has in the last half-century, then those dictionaries and those rules seem silly.&quot;,

    &#39;body&#39;: &#39;Works like Krebs\&#39; are normative, designed to give guidance to those who seek it. When people want to clarify a word\&#39;s usage, they don\&#39;t want Doederlein\&#39;s drunken haze philosophical treatise, they want brevity and clear recommendations. Krebs provides exactly that.\n\nWhen and to what degree to follow Kreb\&#39;s recommendations is up to the reader. Why they do and don\&#39;t want to follow them is also up to them. Krebs\&#39; is just one opinion, albeit a well-researched and authoritative one. There are enough explanations provided for the reader to be able to make some conclusions of their own, or at least have a starting point for further enquiry. The distinctions between what Cicero did and didn\&#39;t use should be employed to build a mental picture of how a word\&#39;s meaning developed, what usage was normal and what wasn\&#39;t.\n\nThe starting point of needing such a work is semantic bleaching. A word that in classical Latin might have been archaically, figuratively, colloquially, poetically, translationesely synonymous with another word gets used so often that it overtakes the default unmarked expression. This leaves a gap where the original marked expression was, which either makes the language poorer or requires an introduction of a substitute, which often creates another gap to be filled - this is the basis of constant semantic drift even when nothing new needs to be described.\n\nThis process obviously needs to be avoided in an ossified language whose sole purpose is to provide a maximally unchanging medium of communication. Nobody wants to learn a different Latin for every 200 years of texts written in it - you can knock yourself out doing that in enough languages already. Appealing to the inappropriateness of this approach in English is missing the whole point of Latin. How many people do you know who are incomprehensible because they\&#39;ve accidentally learned Tudor-era English? The history of Latin covers 5 times as long - if one needs an illustration of the semantic changes that amount of time results in when uninhibited, they need but open one of those Romance etymological dictionaries.\n\nEven to proponents of Living Latin, having a single well-defined standard is important, and as a dead language with little content being produced, it lacks the natural, social means for self-standardisation available to living languages. People who learn Latin tend to also be the erudite type prone to pass judgements on correctness, and it\&#39;s useful to have a reference to substantiate them and settle disputes.\n\nMost Latin-X dictionaries suck - one look at L&amp;amp;S says it all. Even the En-La Smith &amp;amp; Hall rarely bothers to do anything beyond giving a huge list of words that can possibly be translated the same. Add to that a century and a half of semantic shifts inside English itself, and most people end up thinking that half the Latin words can be synonymous, and themselves use whichever word from the list they happen to remember first. At worst they use the word that most resembles the one whose meaning they\&#39;re sure of in a modern language while having no idea about the meaning of the Latin one. Multiply this problem by the number of languages, false friends and bad dictionaries, and the result can be not far from the diversity (and utter wrongness from the point of view of Classical Latin) of New Latin pronunciations. A work like Krebs\&#39; provides a dirty but workable fix for this situation.\n\nThe writers who used the words Krebs recommends against using, were often doing so for special effect - Cicero with his neologising included. They had a programme and a rationale that they were following. In order to be able to recognise this rationale and perceive the diffences between what at first look in L&amp;amp;S might appear to be synonyms, one needs to have a starting point - a firm grasp of what was most likely felt to be unmarked and idiomatic in the classical period. Krebs\&#39; work should be used as a tool to get this grasp.\n\nA reader who takes it to be the end of the journey and the definitive arbiter of style that everyone should unwaveringly follow can blame Krebs for strengthening their misconception about the nature of Latinity, but the misconception itself needs to have been there well before they\&#39;ve opened his book. Classical philology has been long plagued with what modern linguists recognise to be unscientific and socially-biased ideas (c.f. the whole &quot;Vulgar Latin&quot; conundrum), but that doesn\&#39;t mean that the resources the holders of these beliefs produced cannot be used to good results.&#39;,

There are all sorts of ways to ask these kinds of things, but the themes are pretty consistent and amount to exactly what you\&#39;d expect them to be interested in evaluating.

Other than that, prepare for the obvious.\n\n&amp;gt;What do you like about Classics?\n\nPerhaps, though this seems boring to me. I\&#39;d imagine something more specific: &quot;What part of the Classics most interests you?&quot; You\&#39;re obviously coming because something about it is interesting to you, the question is whether or not that thing is also interesting to the faculty in the dependent (since they\&#39;ll be the ones working with you). \n\n&amp;gt;What do you say without being cliche?\n\nYou do some deep soul-searching about predictable questions, find an answer that is honest and genuinely yours, compose it ahead of time in some appropriately concise and effective form, and then practice it - not because your response should seem wrote, but because it will give you facility with saying what you really think in a compelling way ex tempore. And then you just be honest and genuine, because what interests them is you as a person and they can\&#39;t see that if you\&#39;re putting up a front.&#39;,

Caesar is too alien and the stories of the battles too unfamiliar for us to do that with.  \n\nAnd the vulgate too.

    &#39;body&#39;: &quot;10+ years ago, there were several different AP tests with various authors.  College board didn&#39;t want to keep paying for people to write and grade different tests.  $$.  I really, really wish they would switch to a language competency test--like modern languages or a well-written version of the so-so ALIRA that now exists--but that&#39;s not gonna happen any time soon, if ever.  The Latin test will be dropped all together sooner than that happens imo.   So few students take it, even if there were a broad push  from educators to revamp it, I can&#39;t see how the CB would think the investment was worth it.&quot;,

There\&#39;s also the problem that Caesar was a master propagandist and some of what he describes in the DBG is arguably genocide, yet most high schools kinda gloss over that when it\&#39;s really quite important. And, as you suggest, smaller chunks could give students a variety of material and experience in the text without being as overwhelming as a deep dive into a single author.&#39;,

    &#39;body&#39;: &#39;I\&#39;ve found people addressing bishops in letters as *Amplitudo Vestra* (&quot;Your Greatness&quot;) and *Reverende Domine* (&quot;Reverend Lord&quot;). But the context makes it difficult to assess if this address is used because he is a bishop uniquely, or just because he ranks higher than the writer. Still, if in doubt, it is never wrong to use *Domine* (&quot;lord&quot;), which is effectively the Latin equivalent of English *Sir* or *Mister,* compare with Spanish *Señor* and and German *Herr*. \n\nKeep in mind that Church Latin doesn\&#39;t differentiate between short and long vowel - they are all the same length - so don\&#39;t sweat it, unless you want.\n\nAs for blessing, the word is *benedictio*. &quot;The blessing of the Lord be with you&quot; would then be *Benedictio Domini \\[sit\\] super vos* or *Benedictio Domini \\[sit\\] vobiscum*. Keep in mind that Church Latin has the T-V distinction, meaning that you use *vos* (&quot;you&quot; plural) when addressing those above you, unless they insist on the familiar *tu* (&quot;you&quot; singular).&#39;,

I am also reading the English sentence with an implied &#39;that&#39; in the phrase &#39;now (that) we are home again&#39;, in the sense of &#39;because&#39;.  With that reading, I would put &#39;Quod&#39; at the beginning.  \n\nI don&#39;t think you can justify &#39;venit mihi in mentum&#39; as I don&#39;t see it in the English.  Also, &#39;discendi sint&#39; is the 3rd plural.  I think you want the second singular of the gerundive of obligation, not in the subjunctive: &#39;discendus es&#39; (or &#39;discenda&#39; if &#39;You&#39; is feminine).\n\nI&#39;m not 100% on any of this so hopefully someone more knowledgeable will disagree as needed.&quot;,

As it happens, rhotacism in Latin is quite well-known among Latinists, so you won&#39;t amaze many redditors on this sub with what you&#39;ve found. I even see you got a few downvotes.\n\nBut the kind of reasoning you&#39;ve displayed here can lead you to many interesting parts of the Latin language, and even other languages. So don&#39;t be discouraged, and keep an eye out for these apparent anomalies. After you&#39;ve learned about enough of them, you&#39;ll start to be able to explain some of them yourself, and you&#39;ll start noticing connections all over the place.&quot;,

    &#39;body&#39;: &quot;Rhotacism is quite common across the world. My village’s dialect of Neapolitan language has developed (a somewhat different form of) rhotacism, while that of the neighboring village didn’t. Therefore from Latin _digitum_, we have inherited /&#39;reʃǝtǝ/ and our neighbors /&#39;deʃǝtǝ/.&quot;,

    &#39;body&#39;: &#39;As a fun fact, this also happened very early in the development of English (possibly in Proto-Germanic?) This yields the pairs &quot;most&quot; v. &quot;more&quot;, &quot;is&quot; v. &quot;are&quot;, and &quot;was&quot; v. &quot;were&quot;.\n\nIf anyone\&#39;s wondering how such a seemingly weird change might happen, it\&#39;s important to note that intervocalic /s/ will often be voiced to /z/, which may easily be pronounced something like [dz]. If your language\&#39;s /r/ is the alveolar tap, like in Latin, those are articulated in nearly the same place, so it\&#39;s not as big a phonetic leap as it seems.&#39;,

    &#39;body&#39;: &#39;Because we know the root is *dek- by comparing other words, like decet, and that -os is a standard suffix used to make nouns. Hence *dekos. The nominative decor is remodelled after the genitive, similar to honos/honor.\n\nThis sort of rhotacism is very common in Latin as well as in many other Italic dialects, to more or less the same degree.&#39;,

    &#39;body&#39;: &#39;There’s a sound change called _rhotacism_, because of which /s/ between to vowels turns into /r/. Another sound change is unstressed vowel reduction.\n\nApplying these sound changes, the original declension:\n\n\t*dĕcŏs\n\t*dĕcŏs-ĕs\n\nHas regularly become:\n\n\tdĕcŭs\n\tdĕcŏr-ĭs\n\nIn some cases, reshaping happened, so that the nominative could match the stem.\n\n\thŏnōs &amp;lt; *hŏnŏs-s\n\t*hŏnŏs-ĕs\n\nHas turned into\n\n\thŏnōr\n\thŏnōr-ĭs\n\nThe vowel in the genitive changed to match the nominative, the consonant in the nominative to match the genitive (but _hŏnōs_ is actually attested in the oldest writings).&#39;,

    &#39;body&#39;: &#39;[An Explanation of the Greek in LGPSI](https://thepatrologist.com/2019/09/02/introducing-lgpsi-a-guide-for-the-uncertain/):\n\n&amp;gt;LGPSI at present teaches ‘Koine Greek with Attic sprinkles’. It does this for several reasons. Firstly, the vast bulk of ancient Greek literature is written in Koine. Students who study Koine are well situated to access this material. Secondly, for those whose interest is primarily biblical and related studies, Koine is the idiom of primary interest. Thirdly, a significant portion of Koine writers deliberately and conscientiously employ a high-register of Koine that contains Attic features, for which reason you will find plenty of Attic influence in this text. Fourthly, the historical setting of the main storyline is late antiquity. I believe that students whose main interest is “classical literature” and “classical Greek” will still be well served by this text.\n\n&amp;gt;That said, I do have in mind that LGPSI as a broader project of multiple stories may, indeed should, grow to include spin-off texts that may focus on specific authors/dialects/periods. That would include a ‘high Attic’, a Homeric book, a Byzantine one, and other possibilities.&#39;,

If you are interested in the Greek of the Bible and similarly temporal texts, this is more than fine, but if you have any interest in the Attic Greek of Classical Athens, it&#39;s better to learn that first as Koine is effectively a much simplified form of it, so it&#39;s easier to read Koine texts because there is little new other than vocabulary. Whereas Attic Greek has many more grammatical features you would have to learn even with a good focus of Koine (such as the entire optative mood).\n\nBut this still looks like a good start for sure; I would just make sure to use other resources for Attic if that&#39;s what you are interested in.&quot;,

He studied a range of others and, to paraphrase Poliziano, expressed Cicero. He was the only one who could authentically express Cicero. The very best an imitator could hope for is to be the very best 2nd-rate Cicero. \n\nIt&#39;s better to aim to be a 1st-rate version of whomever you are. There&#39;s nothing wrong with EMULATING Cicero, by studying a variety of authors and trying to use them to express what you alone can express. Just as Cicero did.&quot;,

Looks like Spigen is sending us clues on how to acquire that which we desire in our lifetime. The Key appears to be within us. The looking glass mirror on the left, serves as a reflection of the Person. The compass/north star signifies Direction. And the DNA stem on the right is actually code for 143: I Love You.

    &#39;body&#39;: &#39;I am a philosophy student, and had similar reasons and motivations for learning Latin.\n\nI highly recommend the book &quot;Learn to Read Latin&quot; by Keller and Russell. It has tons of footnotes and details explaining the &quot;why&quot; of every grammatical question you might have. Additionally you need to buy the accompanying workbook which has over a hundred practice sentences/paragraphs per chapter. If you do it in order - read the textbook, write down and memorize the vocab, complete the workbook pages, for each chapter, then you will be able to read basic prose texts within months. \n\nI started and completed the book between last August and December, and now I\&#39;m able to read most philosophy texts with a dictionary. I\&#39;m also taking a 4th semester college class in Latin Poetry, which is already easy for me. Of course I already had excellent training in Ancient Greek so that helped, but with your German background you should be able to get to a high level within a year. Just pick a textbook/course/method, and keep practicing regularly without long breaks.&#39;,

    &#39;body&#39;: &quot;Also here&#39;s an old comment that I saved.   \n \n \nThere are a couple of other Orbergized texts, such as Caesars Gallic wars and Plautus&#39; Amphityro. After that you could start on Roma Aeterna.   \n  \nThe &#39;Epitome Historiae Sacrae&#39; is impeccably done and I would say that most of the stories are mostly familiar to most people (which is mostly helpful). Mostly.   \n\n  \nBetween Familia Romana and Roma Aeterna, read:   \nRitchie&#39;s Fabulae Faciles   \nNutting&#39;s De America.  \nCaesaris: Commentarii De Bello Gallic  \nSermones Romani  \nPlautus: Amphitryo Comoedia  \nEpitome Historiae Sacra  \n  \nAs you&#39;re reading Roma Aeterna, read:  \nOvid: Ars Amatoria (finish first 5 chapters of Roma Aeterna)  \nVergilii Maronis: Aeneis (alongside RA)  \nPetronius: Cena Trimalchionis (halfway through RA cap 36-47)  \nTibulii Elegiae (Roma Aeterna, cap 36-45) [available on lulu.com]  \n  \nAfter you&#39;ve read Roma Aeterna, read Sallustus &amp;amp; Cicero, Catilina.  \n  \nUncertain placement:   \nVergilis: Bucolica Carmena  \nLucretius: De Rerum Natura  \nVita Moresque by Luigi Miraglia (2009)&quot;,

But my intentions is to understand latin texts, not speak it fluently. Correct me if I&#39;m wrong, but i don&#39;t think many people speak latin. If i have understood correctly, most use it for studying topics like science or for other reading. My goal is to read, understand and form texts. \n\nAlso, it is my own chooseing to learn the language and i have studied others online before, i know my own capabilities. I might have a few speaking errors in those languages, but my intentions was never to speak 100% without failure. My gaol was to understand and experience the new and unique ways of thinking that a foring language bring, to read the thought only expressed in that particular language and by that scale up my view of other parts of the world.&quot;,

    &#39;body&#39;: &#39;Try Memoria Press! It’s not online, but I think it’ll be of help to you. It’s a company that does classical education curricula, and they have a great Latin textbook series which, with dedication, you can definitely study by yourself. I’ve been self-studying from their series for years, and I think it’s just what you’re looking for: they don’t just tell you what to say, they tell you exactly what the grammar is and how it works. I’m not sure if they ship to Denmark, but they probably do, and if not, check eBay or the like. I’d suggest starting with First Form Latin. Make sure you get the teacher’s manual, but if you do you won’t need the student book, just the workbook and answer key. Good luck!&#39;,

    &#39;body&#39;: &#39;Purchase a book called “Familia Romana” and any associated materials. The book is entirely in Latin, but it is written in an intuitive way that you can learn from context by looking at the diagrams and margin notes as you read. It starts out extremely simply. If you stick with it until the end, you should know a fair amount of Latin. I believe it includes 1800 words.&#39;,

    &#39;body&#39;: &quot;I would suggest that you take a look at different Latin books and how they proceed. They usually go from simple structures to difficult ones. You would for example first have simple sentences, subject 3rd person indicative verb, then introduce objects with their corresponding cases, then build from there. It&#39;s handy to follow along with a book of sorts because that way you have texts that are written for the sole purpose of studying the language. Reading originals right away is probably too difficult.&quot;,

    &#39;body&#39;: &#39;First of all, in all likelyhood there wasn\&#39;t any actual H in those words (see my reply about *sehen*). I understand that two short /i/\&#39;s put together sounding like a long /ī/ make sense to you - what I\&#39;m asking about is: what does this fact tell you about the quality of the short /i/? Suppose short and long i\&#39;s sounded differently - what would they contract to in this case?\n\nAll right, I admit it, it was a trick question. The result would be the same, because:\n\n1. in the Classical period, antevocalic /i/ had the same quality as the long /ī/ because it was phonemically long, shortened by the general &quot;vocalis ante vocalem corripitur&quot; rule (*fīlī + us = fīlius*). For the same reason, the Romans heard the \\[ɪ\\~e\\] of Greek εια, and the same vowel in rustic Latin pronunciation of *via* as /ē/ (Varro\&#39;s *veha*) and transcribed it as such (*Aenēās, Alexandrēa*) until it was raised to \\[i\\] again in both languages (*Alexandrīa*).\n2. even if it had contracted into the closest vowel still different from /ī/ - /ei/ - it would still be /ī/ in Classical Latin after the merger of /ei/ and /ī/ about 150 BC.\n3. there\&#39;s no reason to believe nīl and mī contracted during the Classical period. Their original forms are *\\*nehīlum* and \\**mehei*. The former could have undergone simple elision of /e/; in the latter, neither vowel is original /i/; in any case, both could have contracted to /ei/ before merging with /i/. Both are thus potentially irrelevant to what a contraction of two i\&#39;s would result in in Classical Latin.\n\nAs for the English /ɪ/, you seem to have entirely misunderstood me. ɪ might be an IPA symbol, but it transcribes completely different vowels in different varieties of English - even when the transcription is supposed to be phonetic/narrow, included in square brackets! Allen\&#39;s vowel in &quot;bit&quot; was likely not the same as yours, as is still the case for almost all British English pronunciations - they lack the American vowel of &quot;bit&quot;.\n\nThe reason that American vowel is transcribed with \\[ɪ\\] is tradition. In Californian English, as in many other American varieties, that vowel is a vowel between IPA \\[e\\], \\[ə\\] and \\[ɛ\\] - as can be seen in [this Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vowel_diagram) or by googling &quot;english vowel diagram&quot; or &quot;space&quot;. Vox Latina is talking about a vowel between IPA \\[i\\] and \\[e\\]. As most other descriptions in that book, it lacks scientific rigor and is merely an approximation - what sort of vowel Allen himself had in &quot;bit&quot; can only be guessed at from contemporary descriptions of RP. What Allen definitely didn\&#39;t mean, however, is the vowel you\&#39;re most likely to have in that word. When you or others try to argue against Allen\&#39;s \\[ɪ\\] for CL /i/, they\&#39;re a priori wrong because the vowel Allen is discribing is not the vowel they themselves pronounce. Australian English speakers, on the other hand, don\&#39;t tend to argue that becasue their /ɪ/ is close or identical to IPA \\[i\\]  - but their /i/ is a diphthong!\n\nThis is the reason I\&#39;m saying that English has no one single pronunciation of the vowel in &quot;bit&quot;, or any other single vowel, regardless of how these vowels are traditionally transcribed, and that anyone who describes Latin pronunciation by referencing the vowels of English is a priori wrong: there\&#39;s neither one English, nor one English vowel system.&#39;,

    &#39;body&#39;: &#39;I think the &quot;bending&quot; in *sehen* is due to the contrast between stressed first syllable and unstressed second syllable, causing a change of tone. Russian\&#39;s example in wikitionary sounds quite weird for me - I\&#39;ve never heard *sehen, stehen* etc. pronounced like this, even by Austrians, and it isn\&#39;t properly stressed because of her intonation. Probably her intonation fits better into an interrogative sentence like &quot;Kannst du mich sehen?&quot; I suppose /ˈseː.ən/ is expected as Austrian standard instead of  /ˈzeː.ən/ due to devoicing in /#CV/. Perhaps that\&#39;s some kind of Austrian dialect?&#39;,

    &#39;body&#39;: &#39;The &quot;bending&quot; in German is because the spelling &amp;lt;ehe&amp;gt; represents the root long vowel /e:/ followed by the schwa /ə/ that belongs to the infinitive suffix. In colloquial speech the schwa is often dropped, but in careful pronunciation both are realised according to the morphemic make-up.\n\nThe case is different in Latin, at least in the Republican one, where sequences of identical vowels mandatorily contract. Poetic license allows scanning them as two syllables, but since native Latin phonotactics don\&#39;t allow vowel hiatus, you\&#39;ll have to fill it with some sort of a glide, or perhaps even an /h/, or pronounce the second vowel differently from the first, which becomes the glide. I\&#39;m 100% positive *sultis* had the same first vowel as in as *stultus -* in fact it\&#39;s not a result of contraction, but of analogy: vīs : sīs &amp;gt; vultis : *sultis. C*ontraction would result in a long vowel, or indeed the same dipthong /eu/ as in the anteconsonantal *seu* &amp;lt; sei-ve.\n\nAs for the ending -iī, I might need to post a paper on that ;-) In short, it likewise stood for one long vowel from the time /ei/ merged with /ī/ and underwent the same mandatory contraction, which still wasn\&#39;t the case for Plautus, based both on epigraphy (the first I for EI is around 150 BC) and the fact that he has no monosyllabic forms like *grātīs*.&#39;,

    &#39;body&#39;: &quot;I find that when a short vowel is immediately followed by another vowel (e.g., the i in *audiunt*), I tend to pronounce the first vowel with long quality (but not duration), because it&#39;s awkward to pronounce a short quality vowel followed by another vowel.\n\nI&#39;ve noticed that the letter h is grouped with vowels in certain contexts (e.g., *ab* must be used before vowels and h, while *ā* can be used elsewhere), and it seems to me that the awkwardness that I mentioned above extends to short quality vowels followed by an h, as in *mihi*. This is probably because h is always followed by a vowel and &amp;lt;something something exemplified by rough breathing marks in Ancient Greek&amp;gt;.\n\nRegarding the final i in *mihi*: I find it easy to pronounce the first i in *tibi* with short quality, but I find myself wanting to lengthen the quality of the final i (and other final vowels with different long and short qualities).\n\nA possible explanation is that (1) people want to pronounce a given word consistently, and (2) the subsequent word could potentially start with a vowel or an h. So, assuming that one hasn&#39;t progressed to using elision yet, we again run into the short vowel followed by another vowel or h situation unless we lengthen the final vowel quality.&quot;,

    &#39;body&#39;: &quot;I find it awkward and unnatural to say the word with both vowels short. And I&#39;ve been assuming that&#39;s the problem every one else is having. However, I force myself to pronounce the first i short and take the option to pronounce the final i longish, though that&#39;s one of the markings that would probably turn out to be about an option to count the syllable as long in verse and not an indication of actual vowel quality. Dictionaries can be unclear about this. But if I recall correctly, Allen says that for the Romans it was awkward to follow a short penult with a long ultima - pretty much the opposite of my issue.\n\nWhat frustrates me the most is not people faiing following strict pronunciation in conversation, but not following it in recorded instructional material for courses that do use the macrons. People turn to this stuff for help with precisely the things the producers are being lazy about. \n\nI&#39;ve mentioned before in this subreddit that it&#39;s kind of a hobby of mine to collect instructional materials just so I can be annoyed at how inconsistent they are.

People are consciously pronouncing /i/ as \\[i\\] (as in Spanish &quot;mito&quot;) and not as \\[ɪ\\] (as in English &quot;bit&quot;), but keeping it short. There is some debate over the exact quality of Latin vowels, some people argue that short and long vowels have the exact same sound and are only distinguished by duration, so maybe you are not being able to distinguish \\[i\\] and \\[iː\\]. This is a possible outcome if you are an English speaker since English doesn\&#39;t really distinguish vowel length and doesn\&#39;t have the \\[i\\] sound.&#39;,

The introduction provides some general guidance about conventions that allow you to solve abbreviations that aren&#39;t explicitly given. The body of the book provides a fairly comprehensive collection of standard abbreviations and variants. If you&#39;re just starting out in manuscript studies, it will probably cover 99% of what you need. \n\nThere is also Ductus, which is a DVD ROM containing sample texts and transcriptions to help train your paleographic eye.

    &#39;body&#39;: &quot;That&#39;s actually a very good point you&#39;ve made about the viability of Latin as a modern language to use, there&#39;s about a million and a half different things that simply weren&#39;t in existence during the time of the Romans, all of the items you&#39;ve brought up and many more! I do love Latin because of the concise nature of it, even if I don&#39;t get the meaning of the words yet, I know that this verb is being done by this noun, because there&#39;s no ambiguity, at least not any I&#39;ve had to deal with yet! One specific thing I&#39;ve discovered and find very interesting is the presence of hoc this, iste  that (nearby in space, time, or in the sentence), and ille that (further away). I&#39;m fairly confident that&#39;s the correct order, although it may be that I&#39;m mixing iste/ille up. It&#39;s interesting that English doesn&#39;t differentiate here, and it&#39;s not likely that I ever would have thought of the concepts if not for Latin. \n\nAs far as the cases go, I get it mostly. Nom: subject, gen: ownership/relationship, dat: to or for, acc: direct object, and abl: by/with/from/in/on. I don&#39;t have all the different endings memorized, except for the first declension, primarily feminine. I&#39;d like to at least get the basic endings down before I dedicate my time fully to LLPSI, and now I have the classroom reader to incorporate at some point, so I have a long way to go as of yet, but progress is happening! I don&#39;t know how to wish you a good day in Latin, but I do wish you a good day regardless!&quot;,

   {&#39;author&#39;: &#39;honeywhite&#39;,
    &#39;body&#39;: &quot;So, the genitive and the ablative.  This is difficult to *explain*, although I can understand it intuitively.  The genitive is very, very close to the English possessive.  *autocineti Michaëlis* = Mike&#39;s car, the car **of** Mike; *autocinetorum Michaëlis =* Mike&#39;s cars, the cars **of** Mike.  The ablative would most closely correspond to **from** in English.  *Computatro* \\[dat.\\] *Lucii* \\[abl.\\] *virus* \\[nom.\\] *delevi* \\[past perfect\\].  I deleted the virus **from** the computer **of/belonging to** Lucius. \n\nBeyond that, as for the classroom reader, if you like tobacco as much as I do, if you are passionate about smoking, you are going to love it.  There are perhaps 30 pages dedicated to pipes, cigarettes, cigars, and papers.  I was thrilled, mostly because the Romans didn&#39;t know a damn thing about the pleasure of the amber leaf, and there&#39;s this huge gaping hole in their language when I want to talk about that stuff.\n\nThe typewriter also gets coverage.  The bank.  The airport.  Even your waking up routine, getting up out of bed, going to the toilet, etc.  These are all things that Cicero and Cato knew nothing about; for them, taking a Donald Trump in the back garden/atrium and using burdock leaf for loo roll was enough.  They knew no books, no ink, no pens, no biros... I love the Latin language but it can be so *limiting* if you don&#39;t have the words for modern conveniences.  I am an enormous revivalist, I think people should be speaking in Latin, anywhere and everywhere, but when you can&#39;t talk about the party you&#39;re voting for at the election, or tell the plumber your loo&#39;s stopped up, you don&#39;t really have a usable language.&quot;,

I really appreciate it, that seems to be a lot of effort on your part, gratias amicus! I do see the &quot;visual dictionary&quot; parts, those are going to be extremely helpful! \n\nIt does seem extremely intuitive in LLPSI, and there\&#39;s really not a ton that I struggle to understand as long as I\&#39;m thorough with my reading and studies, but I just felt that a foundation of understanding at least what the Genitive means vs the Ablative, which is something I\&#39;m not sure I\&#39;ll ever be able to keep straight, may help me dissect the parts that do cause me difficulty, like the example in my original post. You saying that it\&#39;s not necessary though does give me some new hope that I\&#39;ll be able to sort this all out with my main focus being LLPSI, I just wish there were more ways that I could actively write things out in Latin and have some way to ensure I\&#39;m correct, I feel that is what\&#39;s lacking. Understanding the reading portions is relatively straightforward, but if I were able to write out sentences and be corrected, then those verb forms, tenses and such would stick a little better in my head, and I wouldn\&#39;t be focusing on the foundations of declining nouns and all that, at least not as heavily.\n\nAnyways, extra rambling aside, I\&#39;m super thankful that you\&#39;ve given me that text resource, once again thank you!

    &#39;body&#39;: &#39;Thing is, you don\&#39;t actually *need* the declensions and verb tenses and whatnot; that\&#39;s a relic from the way Latin was taught in the 1800\&#39;s.  Best to learn it the LLPSI way, where you don\&#39;t actually need to know the *words* &quot;third-person&quot;, you just need to know, &quot;this is the way you form your words when you\&#39;re talking about someone else&quot;.\n\nThere is also a Latin classroom reader I put together, that I suggest you print out and bind or something.  I\&#39;m still working on some crosswords and jokes to put in it, and so on, but it\&#39;s in a pretty good stage of completion.  [Click here!](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1ztcJahCSTgpjNM-kfITgfOYbqOzCogtv)  It\&#39;s almost a sort of visual dictionary in places, and you\&#39;ll learn the parts to a bicycle, garage tools, around the office, etc.&#39;,

    &#39;body&#39;: &quot;Right, thank you! Learning through LLPSI is my main study, but I&#39;m also trying to get a solid grasp of the basics such as declensions and whatnot. I&#39;ve been using LatinTutorial on YouTube a lot, listening to the great ScorpioMartianus read through LLPSI, listening to Magister Craft as well, and really just scouring the internet for sources. I joined Latinitium, but I find that to be a difficult one to use since it&#39;s a lot of audio only, at least for a large portion of newbie type stuff. So thank you for the clarification! Having r/Latin here is a wonderful resource, I appreciate all the help I get from you and the others!&quot;,

    &#39;body&#39;: &quot;That&#39;s exactly right!  Grammar nerds (i.e. *not* me) call the (s)he-version *the third-person present active singular*, because it&#39;s happening in the here and now, and only one person&#39;s doing it, and the I-version *the first-person present active singular*.\n\nIf you&#39;re learning from LLPSI, though, it was specifically written to stop you having to worry about active and passive, singular and plural.  So this is just a bit of a tidbit for your further studies.&quot;,

    &#39;body&#39;: &quot;It&#39;s an idiom.  Doesn&#39;t translate exactly.  When you *take* a step, are you picking up a step and moving it somewhere else?  Or are you committing larceny on a step?\n\nThe exact French equivalent is *faire un pas*.  It&#39;s third person present. (i.e. not *facio*, I make, or *facis*, you make), so yes, it applies to Emily.\n\n*Émilie se met debout et fait un pas vers la porte.  Emily stands and takes a step toward the door*.\n\nI don&#39;t see any turning here, though.  And if **I** was the one doing it, rather than Emily, I&#39;d put all the verbs in first-person present: *\\[Ego\\] surgo atq; gradum adversus ostium facio*.&quot;,

Quite simply, there basically two sentences happening here. To rephrase it a bit:\n\n*Aemilia surgit. Facit gradum adversum ostium. *\n\nIf you removed the verb, *facit*, we\&#39;d be left only with *gradum adversum ostium * - a step towards the door, and we wouldn\&#39;t have a full sentence. Without a verb, we have no idea what\&#39;s happening with this step: if Aemilia is taking it, or if Cleopatra is somehow seducing it. Just like we can\&#39;t only say &quot;Malum&quot; to mean &quot;I eat an apple&quot;, we can\&#39;t just say &quot;Gradum&quot; to mean &quot;I take a step&quot;. *Facere* is just as necessary as *take* is in English in &quot;to take a step&quot;. \n\n(I might add that sometimes we can have implied verbs in Latin, but that\&#39;s a whole messy thing that you shouldn\&#39;t worry about right now)&#39;,

    &#39;body&#39;: &#39;Your intuition is exactly right. The verb we\&#39;re seeing here is *facio, facere, fēci, factum*, which is a very broad verb meaning roughly *to make* or *to do*. It ends up being becoming French *faire*, Italian *fare*, and Spanish *hacer*, if you happen to be familiar with any of those. In this case, its subject is Aemilia, and the object is *gradum*. In general, its usage will often be pretty idiomatic, so don\&#39;t bother trying to translate it too literally. After all, in English, when we say &quot;take a step&quot;, does &quot;take&quot; really mean anything here? How could you possibly take a step and bring it somewhere else? \n\nAs a fun fact, *facio* ultimately derives from the Proto-Indo-European root **dʰeh₁-*, which is also the origin of English *do*.&#39;,

    &#39;body&#39;: &#39;From the knowledge I have the only meaningful way to translate this would be as: &quot;Oh old desperate one: They will eat us for the gods&quot;\n&quot;Senex Desperandum&quot; as neuter vocatives, &quot;Nos&quot; accusative, &quot;Comedent&quot; future 3rd plural, &quot;Diis&quot; as a dative of advantage.\nIt would sound cool if it hadn\&#39;t been just an error... Anyway even if word order does not have to be fixed and the grammar does not require anything specific I don\&#39;t quite like as it is ordered with this meaning and the form used, I never found a vocative all over the place and I never found a vocative gerund. So the real meaning should be something like &quot;The old one who should despair [said, heard, knows], they will eat us for the gods&quot; or &quot;Oh old one! For the gods they will eat us and we should despair&quot; (nos desperandum, us who should despair)&#39;,

    &#39;body&#39;: &quot;True. I&#39;m not a wiccan (or anything similar) myself, but I have friends who practice wiccan and the old Norse gods, and they&#39;re happy with their faith. What I especially like about old spells like that, is the way they sort of took the best knowledge available to them from widely different areas (folklore, folk medicin, teaching of the church, tradition etc) and mixed them all together to something they could use. I can see why people today still find those practices interesting and / or seek to improve them.&quot;,

    &#39;body&#39;: &quot;Ah. And those would likely be early precursors to chaos magick, in that (the practitioners believed that) they worked because people believed they would work, and they were done that way because the Catholic Church still used Latin then, and magick of that era was often bound up in the Church, or simply in religious superstition. I was brash to assume it was a teenage girl, and if this type of spellwork does something for the practitioner, even just putting a stressful issue out of mind so they can get on with finding a mundane solution, it&#39;s perfectly legitimate magickal practice.&quot;,

Because French is my native language, and you could translate this sentence as, &quot;les morales des hommes bons seront bonnes&quot;. Which is pretty damn close to &quot;mores hominis boni erunt boni&quot;, even though there are no declensions or cases in French. Which shows that you don\&#39;t even really need to fully figure out the cases to understand sentences like these. You just need to get that there is a genitive for possession, which is just expressed with &quot;des&quot; in French, but the final s in hominis is like the \&#39;s possessive in English, so it\&#39;s pretty straightforward.&#39;,

    &#39;body&#39;: &#39;_volandō_ is neither a past nor a participle. It’s a gerund, which is a verbal noun (opposed to participle and gerundive which are verbal adjectives). For an English speaker, this distinction is tricky, since _-ing_ conveys both participle and gerund.\n\nHence, _nōlī nimis audax esse in volandō_ means «don’t be too bold in flying», but this «flying» in English is a gerund.\n\nHere are some other examples of gerund (declined like a second-declension noun, but lacking nominative, which is expressed by infinitive):\n\n• _ars amandī_ «the art of loving»\n\n• _vir bonus dīcendī perītus_ «a good man skilled in speaking»\n\n• _amīcī ad colloquendum veniunt_ «the friends come for talking/to talk»\n\nYou can notice that the gerund is usually found with intransitive verbs, or transitive verbs without a direct object. If you want to include a direct object, you’ll have to use a gerundive, as in:\n\n• _cīvēs pugnant ad servandam patriam_ «citizens fight to save their fatherland»&#39;,

    &#39;body&#39;: &quot;Exactly! To be clear, you can still use the singular if you are talking in the abstract. It just means something slightly different.\n\nFor comparison, if you take the phrase *What doesn&#39;t kill you, only makes you stronger*, you can read the *what* as plural or singular. If you try to make that explicit in English, you get these two phrases.\n\n*A thing that doesn&#39;t kill you, only makes you stronger*,  \nor   \n*Things that don&#39;t kill you, only make you stronger.*   \n\nFor me, the first one sounds like an abstract, almost philosophical statement. It&#39;s more like a rule or logical deduction than an observation. The second one sounds more practical. It&#39;s an observation based on experience, not a rule based on pure reasoning.\n\nThis means that, as a rule of thumb, you want to use the plural *quae* for this kind of statements in Latin. After all, people aren&#39;t usually talking about philosophical deductions. But if you want to stress the abstract nature of your statement, you could still use the singular.\n\n**edit:** Edited the example sentences to make them a bit clearer.&quot;,

    &#39;body&#39;: &#39;Not gibberish necessarily, only a little confused. The sentiment seems to me to be &quot;We hold art equal to science in its ability to make well&quot;. More literally translated, it says, &quot;I will hold/insist (*tenebo*) that art (*artem*--the use of the accusative here is grammatical) just like (*item*--usually used in conjunction with *ut*; I would prefer just *ut* or *sicut* here myself) the sciences (*scientias*) is (*esse*) medicines (*medicinas*--this part is particularly confused; they should have just used the singular, if my understanding of the general sentiment is correct).&quot;\n\n Overall, not the best Latin I\&#39;ve ever seen; it\&#39;s for the most part grammatically sound, but evinces a lack of knowledge of vocabulary that would allow for a smoother conveyance of the sentiment. There\&#39;s also the fundamental flaw if using *tenebo*: a motto like this is by nature asserting something; to say &quot;I will maintian that...&quot; is just plain redundant. I would have suggested: *ars sicut scientia alit* or *etiam alit ars*.&#39;,

    &#39;body&#39;: &#39;&quot;Integralism&quot; is not a Latin word. However, I can explain what it means broken down into its roots, if that\&#39;s what you mean.\n\n&quot;Integralism&quot; comes, of course, from the adjective &quot;integral&quot;. The word &quot;integral&quot; comes from Latin *integrālis*, formed from the suffix *-ālis* (pertaining to) and the word &quot;*integer*&quot;, meaning &quot;whole&quot; or &quot;intact&quot; (in English, an integer in math is a whole number - a number not broken down into fractions). Within the Latin language, this word doesn\&#39;t break down any further, but we can trace it further back up its lineage to find a deeper root meaning. The word &quot;*integer*&quot; derives from the word *entagros*, from earlier *ntagros*, in Proto-Italic, the reconstructed mother language of Latin and other old italic languages. The prefix &quot;n-&quot; (later &quot;en-&quot;) means &quot;not&quot; - it developed into our prefix &quot;in-&quot; with the same meaning (compare, for example, &quot;inaccessible&quot; - literally, &quot;not accessible&quot;). The root &quot;-tagros&quot; is of the same origin as the Latin verb *tangere* &quot;to touch&quot; (compare &quot;tangible&quot; in English - literally, &quot;touchable&quot;). So, *ntagros* meant &quot;untouched&quot;. Latin *integer* came to mean &quot;whole, intact&quot; as an extended meaning from this. Its semantic development looks something like this: untouched &amp;gt; unharmed &amp;gt; unbroken &amp;gt; intact. On another note, there is another Latin word of the same origin which underwent the same semantic shift - the word &quot;intact&quot; itself. &quot;Intact&quot; comes from Latin *intāctus*, from *in-* &quot;not&quot; + *tāctus* &quot;touched&quot; - *tāctus* is a participle form of the very same Latin *tangere* (compare in English &quot;tactile&quot; - literally, &quot;pertaining to touch&quot;), meaning that *intactus* and *integer* are essentially parallel formations within the same language. \n\nSo then, where did &quot;integral&quot; get its meaning? Well, since &quot;*integer*&quot; in Latin came to mean &quot;whole&quot;, combining it with the suffix *-ālis* gave it the meaning &quot;complete&quot; or &quot;constituting a whole&quot;. Add the suffix &quot;-ism&quot; (&quot;-ism&quot; basically just makes abstract nouns from qualities) and you get something to the effect of, &quot;the concept of constituting a whole&quot;.&#39;,

It takes a while to stop your brain from trying to distribute syllable durations evenly between stresses and instead give each syllable the time it needs and deserves. You might want to read some easy poems - [these ones for instance](http://distichalatina.blogspot.com/). I myself just went with Catullus and Horace xD It really did help me a lot - I even remember when it suddenly clicked for me how and why the word *pàvīméntum* can be pronounced while preserving both the stresses and the quantities - and I realised that I hadn&#39;t understood the whole rhythm and sound of Horace&#39;s *Ēheu, fugācēs...* until that point.

    &#39;body&#39;: &quot;It will feel awkward at first, but you need to change the rhythm from stress-timed to syllable-timed by giving enough time to each syllable. This involves reading considerably slower than you do, and probably also diving sentences in smaller segments. As it is, you use your native stress-timed rhythm, and so seem to glance over the vowel length distinction most of the time in unstressed syllables, while making stressed short vowels long, especially in bisyllabic words  (consistently /āmat/). Long vowels seem to be most often preserved on word ends in ablatives. The other issue is that nasalisation is too weak, sometimes I don&#39;t hear it at all. Also, Latin doesn&#39;t allow phonetic words of less than two moras, so all letter names end in long vowels or in consonans (ā, bē, cē etc). Most of the other basics seem really solid to me. Use [these pronunciations](https://forvo.com/user/Sobakus/) as a guide.&quot;,

The Shakespeare analogy is useful: Shakespeare is still very widely read today, and often imitated, very often quoted. Shakespeare is an extremely powerful force in fixing the English language in one version. Chaucer (14th century) is seldom read today in untranslated form, and is much more difficult for the non-specialist to read. The Latin Classics -- Cicero, Caesar, Vergil, Horace, Ovid, etc, etc -- have never ceased to be read from their own time to the present day. Both Spinoza and Descartes were widely read in both the Latin and the Greek Classics.&#39;,

    &#39;body&#39;: &#39;I think you’re pretty much right with meaning. Going very literally, I would translate it “the best, which [is] also honest,” and in a way that’s more reasonable to English speakers, “that which is best is also honest.” It’s pretty common to see forms of esse (the to-be verb) dropped, especially in something like this that’s meant to be short, and not having any verb at all gives us an indication that that’s what’s going on. If the Latin were perfectly complete, it might go something like “optima quaeque sit honesta,” where we use the subjunctive sit instead of the indicative est because quae introduces a subordinate clause. (It’s worth noting that it’s just possible that optima, quae, and honesta are actually neuter plural instead of feminine singular, in which case the verb would need to be plural, sint.) What I’m not sure of, though, is whether it might be better to translate with “must be” or “should be” rather than “is.” Does this grammar seem right to everyone? Have I made any mistakes? \n\nOP, where’d you find this?&#39;,

One of the greatest benefits of an understanding of Latin is how thorough an understanding of the cases it gives you, which is by far the most challenging part of German (and many other languages).

If they&#39;re looking for something a little easier, their Latin experience should make spanish/italian/french a breeze.&quot;,

    &#39;body&#39;: &#39;Are you looking into modern languages? I studied Latin thoroughly for a few years and now I\&#39;m learning German. Just like Latin, it\&#39;s an inflected language and has a case system (4 cases). I continually find lots of parallels and between German, Latin, and English. I almost consider it a &quot;Latinized&quot; English, if such conclusion can be made&#39;,

    &#39;body&#39;: &quot;Congratulations! It wasn&#39;t easy: different grammar from modern languages and many words with a lot of meanings. I have been studying Latin since 2013 and I can translate easy texts like those from Julius Caesar, the Church and the Medieval ones, but writings from harder authors like Cicero still look challenging to me. I hope to improve my Latin when I&#39;ll have some free-time. I would suggest you to begin studying Ancient Greek as the next language because it influenced Latin a lot and also the European culture. It can also be useful to understand a huge number of Science&#39;s words and you can read a lot of Philosophers&#39; writings in their native language.&quot;,

The mouth kind of automatically morphs the &#39;U&#39; sound into the glide we English speakers know as a &#39;W&#39;, resulting in more of a sal-weh ([sal.wɛ:]).

    &#39;body&#39;: &#39;**Stone rubbing**\n\nStone rubbing is the practice of creating an image of surface features of a stone on paper.  The image records features such as natural textures, inscribed patterns or lettering.  By rubbing hard rendering materials over the paper, pigment is deposited over protrusions and on edges; depressions remain unpigmented since the pliable paper moves away from the rendering material.  Common rendering materials include rice paper, charcoal, wax, graphite or inksticks.\n\n***\n\n^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&amp;amp;message=Excludeme&amp;amp;subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/latin/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot)   ^]\n^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28&#39;,

The word directly derives from the Greek for leeks and just as clearly refers to the green end, not the white one.\n\nWhat almost certainly happened is your friend got the Prasini (the _Leek Green_ faction at the chariot races) mixed up with the _Veneti_ (the _Venetian Blue_ faction).&#39;,

    &#39;body&#39;: &#39;Colour words in Greek are weird, and in Latin even weirder.  Firstly, they use words where to us the colour seems wrong, such as &quot;purple snow&quot;.  Secondly, they have an extremely limited range of words, especially for the blue/green colours. \n\nWe think that what’s going on is that they were more interested in describing the effect of light on the object.  That’s how they have two words for black, one for shiny, one for sooty.  And &quot;purple&quot; really means &quot;with a sort of sparkly effect&quot;.\n\nSo we can’t expect a correspondence between English colour words and theirs.&#39;,

The full volume can be found here: [https://books.google.com/books?id=udhoAAAAcAAJ](https://books.google.com/books?id=udhoAAAAcAAJ)\n\nEach line of your text has a repeating section of text, and that makes it hard to read; not only that, but the text it chooses is a little odd.  Most of the lines *almost* match Cortestius&#39; poem, but not quite: for instance, one line on your text reads *si digna facis quae nulla vestutas regna*, while Cortesius&#39; line is *Carminibus si digna facis, quae nulla vestutas*, and *regna* is nowhere to be found on that line or the following.  It seems to make a habit of changing a single word from Cortesius&#39; lines: for instance, in the line *Matthia Corvine chelyn: si delphica parent*, your text has *petisuae* instead of *Matthia*.  In the next line, your text follows Cortesius&#39; (*Templa tibi, sentitque; frequens tua nomina Cyrrha*), except dropping the first word.  \n\nI think your text might change enough to make it just a jumble of phrases, without any overarching sense, but I might try translating the relevant portion of Cortesius&#39; poem that it&#39;s drawing from.&quot;,

    &#39;body&#39;: &#39;&quot;I\&#39;m intrigued that Aristotle would be the next most popular in manuscripts&quot;\n\nI don\&#39;t know whether he is, I\&#39;m just guessing. \n\nAnd then of course there\&#39;s Cicero, who, like Augustine and Aristotle, wrote a great number of separate works.\n\nIf I recall correctly, there are about 800 manuscript of Vergil extant, and most of them contain the Aeneid, the Georgics and the Eclogues. Quite an impressive number of manuscripts all with the same content. And of course, close to a dozen manuscripts of Vergil are 5th century or earlier, unequaled by any other Classical Latin author. \n\nIf we count all of the tiny papyrus fragments discovered at Oxyrhynchus, Homer is now well up into the thousands of extant manuscripts.&#39;,

    &#39;body&#39;: &quot;For about a millennium, Augustine was pretty much THE theologian of the Latin Church, so that certainly helped his standing.  Then Martin Luther was originally an Augustinian friar, and he tried to simply follow Augustine&#39;s true doctrine, so the original Lutheranism is strongly Augustinian.  Augustine also frequently discussed philosophy (the last two or three books of the *Confessiones* are about the philosophy of time), so many philosophers have drawn from or responded to him.  Then there&#39;s the sheer amount of works he wrote (which helps grow that 15,000 manuscript number).  Like him or not, his influence was enormous.\n\nI&#39;m intrigued that Aristotle would be the next most popular in manuscripts, mainly due to the fact that, until the later Middle Ages, the West only had a few of his works, mainly those on logic (though, to be fair, those were very well-used).  It&#39;s certainly possible, but just a bit surprising to me.  Of course, I can&#39;t think of another author that could be comparable either: even with the popularity of Virgil, he only wrote three works (if you discount the ones attributed to him, like the *Culex*), compared to Aristotle&#39;s dozens.&quot;,

    &#39;body&#39;: &quot;I still have not understood the fascination of Augustine, but clearly, he has been greatly beloved by very many readers, and who am I to say they are wrong?\n\nI recently learned that there is an organization which is compiling a catalog of all of the manuscripts of Augustine. Over 15,000 and counting. That&#39;s a testament to a very dedicated readership in the pre-printing era. The only author I can think of who might possibly be represented in a comparable number of manuscripts is Aristotle, mostly because of the very great surviving number of manuscripts of Aristotle in Latin translation. The Bible is represented in more manuscripts than Augustine, but it&#39;s the work of many authors.&quot;,

    &#39;body&#39;: &quot;From the same time as Jerome, we can&#39;t forget Augustine&#39;s *Confessiones*, often considered the first Western autobiography.  \n\nThomas Aquinas&#39; *Summa Theologiae* (or *Summa Theologica*) was the capstone of Scholastic theology, and philosophy as well (since he saw that philosophy, along with all other sciences, are *ancillae* of theology).\n\nIn the realm of science, there&#39;s also Copernicus&#39; *De revolutionibus orbium coelestium*, which launched the Copernican Revolution.\n\nA fun bonus: if you want to see early concrete poetry, look up Rabanus Maurus&#39; *De laudibus sanctae crucis*.  It&#39;s a set of Latin poems arranged in squares, with additional designs added on top, and the letters within the designs form sub-poems within the larger poem.  For instance, it opens with [this poem](https://www.facsimilefinder.com/articles/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/1-Hraban-Ludwig.jpg), dedicated to the Emperor.  An image of the Emperor is imposed on the poem, and different parts of the picture form new poems.  For instance, the Emperor&#39;s crown reads *Tu, Hludovicum, Christe, corona*, and his shield holds a pair of elegiac couplets:\n\n*Nam scutum fidei depellit tela nefanda,*\n\n*Protegit Augustum clara tropaea parans*\n\n*Devotum pectus divino munere fretum*\n\n*Illaesum semper castra inimica fugat*.\n\nThankfully, Rabanus wrote a commentary which spells out each of these sub-poems, in case you have trouble tracking the letters.&quot;,

If it is a fact, then no, use the indicative.\n\nThough to add to quamvis: you can also use quamquam or etsi with indicatives or cum with a subjunctive.

    &#39;body&#39;: &#39;Quamvis, as a conjunction, introduces a supposition &quot;although&quot; and takes a subjunctive. The main clause will employ tamen as &quot;nevertheless&quot; and whatever the main clause reads will be independent of this (if you use, say a potential subjunctive, then subjunctive; statement indicative). Cicero is a good place to see quamvis + subjunctive.\n\nIt does not always use the subjunctive as a conjunction, however. Livy uses the indicative with it. \n\nQuamvis can also modify another adverb/adjective/verb/verbal noun as &quot;however much you wish&quot; or &quot;to whatever degree.&quot; You can see this is Catullus and others.

    &#39;body&#39;: &#39;Fun fact, the English word &quot;exit&quot; is actually a direct borrowing from the Latin *exit*, the third person singular present indicative of *exire* meaning &quot;to go out&quot; or &quot;to leave&quot;. The word *exit* was originally used in stage directions for plays to indicate that a given character was to leave or &quot;exit&quot; the scene. So in Hamlet, you might see a stage direction that reads [exit Hamlet] or [exit Ophelia] during a scene.\n\nThe plural form of the word, *exeunt*, was also used to indicate that more than one character would leave a scene at the same time, so you might read [exeunt Hamlet &amp;amp; Ophelia] as well, although the word *exeunt* never caught on quite as well as its singular counterpart in English.&#39;,

The word &quot;*angustus*&quot;, for example, has no /ɲ/ sound in any of its descendants in the Romance languages (Spanish &quot;*angosto*&quot;, for instance, is pronounced as /ãŋˈɡost̪o/, not /a\&#39;ɲost̪o/)  or in its ancestors (&quot;*angustus*&quot; is a cognate of English &quot;angst&quot;, of Germanic origin, both from Proto-Indo European root  *h₂enǵʰust- ).&#39;,

Sometimes &quot;ae&quot; and &quot;oe&quot; are not pronounced &quot;e&quot; and to distinguish it we put a dieresis on the &quot;e&quot;, for example &quot;aër&quot; or &quot;poëta&quot; and they are pronounced &quot;ae&quot; or &quot;oe&quot;. In Church Latin the vowel lenght is only useful to know where we should put the accent. If the second-last syllabe has a vowel with a long lenght then we put there the accent, if it has a short lenght we put the accent on the vowel of the previous one syllabe. Therefore &quot;apple&quot; is pronounced &quot;màlum&quot; and &quot;bad&quot; is pronounced &quot;malùm&quot;. The same is for &quot;populus&quot; or &quot;palus&quot;.&#39;,

    &#39;body&#39;: &#39;Your choir director is correct... in the ecclesiastical pronunciation. Classical choral pieces were by and large written as religious works, so they used the Latin of the Catholic Church, the *Ecclesia*. This manner of pronunciation coincides more closely with modern Italian. This means that &quot;c&quot; and &quot;g&quot; are pronounced as soft /t͡ʃ/ and /d͡ʒ/ (the English sounds &quot;ch&quot; and &quot;j&quot;) respectively before &quot;e&quot; and &quot;i&quot;, and the consonant &quot;v&quot; is always pronounced /v/ as in English. The digraphs &quot;ae&quot; and &quot;oe&quot; are both pronounced as an &quot;eh&quot; sound, as you mentioned, and short vs. long vowels are not distinguished. \n\nThis is how the Church speaks Latin, and it was for this kind of Latin that your piece was written, so you should indeed pronounce it as such for your choir. This was not, however, how the ancient Romans actually spoke. In the classical pronunciation, &quot;ae&quot; and &quot;oe&quot; are pronounced /ae̯/ and /oe̯/ (close to &quot;eye&quot; and &quot;oy&quot; in English), &quot;c&quot; and &quot;g&quot; are always pronounced as hard /k/ and /g/, even before &quot;e&quot; and &quot;i&quot;,  and the consonant &quot;v&quot; is pronounced like a &quot;w&quot; always. Vowel length is phonemic, meaning that, often times, a long vowel has a different sound quality from its short equivalent (for example, short &quot;u&quot; is pronounced /ʊ/, while long &quot;ū&quot; is pronounced /uː/) meaning *malum* (bad) and *mālum* (apple) were distinct in pronunciation, one with a short &quot;a&quot; and the other with a long &quot;a&quot;.&#39;,

    &#39;body&#39;: &#39;Different countries have developed different pronunciations of Latin over time. \n\nUsing the Church Latin pronunciation (which is basically the Italian pronunciation), *ae* is pronounced the same as *e*, /e/ (like English &quot;bed&quot;). *C* before *i, e, ae* and *oe* is pronounced  /tʃ/ (*ch* in &quot;church&quot;) and as /k/ in the other cases. *G* before *i, e, ae* and *oe* is /dʒ/ (*j* in &quot;just&quot;) and as a hard /g/ in the other cases (*g* in &quot;go&quot;).\n\nIn the traditional pronunciation found in Germanic-speaking countries, it is the same as the Italian one, but *g* is always a hard /g/, and *c* before *i, e, ae* and *oe* is /ts/ (*ts* in &quot;it\&#39;s&quot; and &quot;hats&quot;), although some would pronounce it straight up as /s/. \n\nI\&#39;ve heard both Church Latin pronunciation and German pronunciation used by choirs.&#39;,

Some generic ones like *canis latrans* (coyote) are proper Latin (*canis latrans* means &quot;barking dog&quot; in fine Latin), but most of the scientific names I see just use Greek words that are latinized or use latinized names of species the Romans had no word for, and others are straight jibberish - arbitrary names with a Latin ending slapped on them (the scientific names of new species are decided by their discoverers, most of whom, like most people, do not know Latin). All in all, most scientific names don\&#39;t really carry any meaning, at least in Latin.&#39;,

    &#39;body&#39;: &#39;I don’t think the English is intended to be a translation of the Latin. The reason this thing exists in the first place is because people know *veni vidi vici* and what it means. I think it’s *intended* to shift perspective from *I* to *we*, something that gels very nicely with the general theme.\n\nOther people seem to read it this way too. For example [here](https://blog.foster.uw.edu/veni-vini-amici-came-saw-loved/) is a blog post that uses the I/we perspective shift in the title, but where it appears as “I” elsewhere in the blog when an individual rather than group perspective is appropriate, indicating the author is aware of what is going on here. Or, in anticipation of the objection that it is unclear how much Latin the author of the above post knows, consider [this tweet](https://twitter.com/LatinProgramme/status/706862982735638528?s=20) by The Latin Programme, an [educational charity](https://beta.charitycommission.gov.uk/charity-details/?regid=1126564&amp;amp;subid=0) which, I assume, surely is not entirely ignorant of Latin conjugation . . .&#39;,

Most of the time when I see people talk about Latin verbs, they’ll give either one word - the infinitive (or sometimes the first person singular); or four - the four principle parts, which in this case would be “venio, venire, veni, ventum” (using the supine here because intransitive).\n\nDo other countries use different numbers of principle parts?&#39;,

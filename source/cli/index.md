# Command Line Interfaces

## What is the Command Line?

The command line, also known as the command prompt or the terminal, is the original method for interacting with the computer, by typing commands.

### How to use the Command Line

#### Windows 
On Windows, you can use two graphical programs to access the command prompt. One is called "Command Prompt" and the other "Windows Terminal." The latter has more functions than the first. 

For more details on the Windows Terminal environment, please see here: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/terminal/

#### MacOS 
On MacOS, you can use the built-in Terminal program to access the command prompt.

#### Linux 
On Linux, you can use a variety of built-in Terminal programs such as Gnome Terminal, Konsole, and XTerm.

### The Shell

The Terminal connects you with an interface called a "shell" which is a command line interface that interprets your typed commands and informs the computer (and it's operating system) what to do with them. There are a few commonly used shells, such as Bourne-Again shell (bash) and Z shell (zsh). Each shell is slightly different in features, but they each provide tab completin, input and output redirection, variable creation, if-then conditions, and file system interface.

# Cluster login

```{important}
   VPN - Off-campus access from non-Tufts Network please connect to [Tufts VPN](https://access.tufts.edu/vpn)
```

```{important}
   Requires and active Cluster Account

There are two main ways to access the HPC cluster to run software.  These are command line access via SSH, and web browser access via the [OnDemand Portal](https://ondemand.pax.tufts.edu).
We also provide methods to use X Window System (X11) to access a **GUI** running on a cluster node.



- Recommended SSH Client software
  > - Cross-Platform: [SecureCRT](https://access.tufts.edu/securecrt)
  > - Native:  Windows 11, Mac and Linux all include a command line SSH clients in the OS.  This `scp` command can be used for quick connections without installing additional software.
  > - Windows: [PuTTY](https://www.putty.org/)


## SSH

The SSH protocol aka **Secure Shell** a method for secure remote login from one computer to another. 

```{important}
   SSH login host is login.pax.tufts.edu (formerly login.cluster.tufts.edu)
```

- Command for Shell environment (default: bash):

  - `$ ssh your_utln@login.cluster.tufts.edu` 

- Explanation of the Command:
  - `ssh`: The command to initiate an SSH connection.The SSH protocol aka **Secure Shell** is a method for secure remote login from one computer to another.
  - `your_utln@login.cluster.tufts.edu`: Replace your_utln with your actual Tufts username. This is the address of the remote HPC cluster.

- What Happens After Running the Command for Login:
  - You will be prompted to enter your password.
  - You will complete the 2FA process if required.

Now you are on a **Login Node** of the cluster (login-prod-0x) and in your **Home Directory** (~ or */cluster/home/your_utln*). 

`$ [your_utln@login-prod-02 ~]`

There are 3 login nodes: `login-prod-01`, `login-prod-02`, `login-prod-03` 

***Please DO NOT run any software on the login nodes.***

- Setting up [SSH keyless access](_https://www.tecmint.com/ssh-passwordless-login-using-ssh-keygen-in-5-easy-steps/_) 

  * Be sure your `~/.ssh` permission is correct! Otherwise, SSH won't work properly.

  * `. ssh` directory: 700 ( drwx------ )

  * public key ( `. pub` file): 644 ( -rw-r--r-- )

  * private key (` id_rsa` ): 600 ( -rw------- )

  

```{important}
   Please DO NOT run any software on the login nodes.

# Software Applications

The research computing team strives to make current versions of most common application available for users to run. 
Applications installed globally on Tufts HPC cluster are managed by environment modules - [Lmod](../Access/0050_modules.md).

If you dont see a common application used in your scientific domain please reach out to us about having it installed.

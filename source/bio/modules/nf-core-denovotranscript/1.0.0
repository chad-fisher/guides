module-whatis   nf-core denovotranscript pipeline
module-whatis   "Description: nf-core/denovotranscript is a bioinformatics pipeline for de novo transcriptome assembly of paired-end short reads from bulk RNA-seq. It takes a samplesheet and FASTQ files as input, perfoms quality control (QC), trimming, assembly, redundancy reduction, pseudoalignment, and quantification. It outputs a transcriptome assembly FASTA file, a transcript abundance TSV file, and a MultiQC report with assembly quality and read QC metrics."
